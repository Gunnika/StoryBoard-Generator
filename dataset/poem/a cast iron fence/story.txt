A cast-iron fence,A bed of pine,How sweet that I no longerNeed to be jealous.A bed's made for meWith sobbing and prayer;Now go wherever on earthYou wish, God bless you!Now your ears won't burnWith frenzied speech,Now a candle won't flickerTill the dawn.We've achieved a peace,And immaculate days…You weep – I'm not worthA single one of your tears. 5.9 Add  'A cast-iron fence,' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
