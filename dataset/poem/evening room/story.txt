Ispeak those words, today, that comeOnly once, born in the spirit.Bees hum on white chrysanthemum:There's the must of an old sachet.And the room, with narrow windows,Preserves love, remembers the past.Over the bed a French script flows:It reads: 'Lord, have mercy on us.'Those saddened marks of so ancient a tale,You mustn't touch, my heart, or seek to…Isee bright Sèvres statuettes grow pale:Even as their lustre grows duller too.A last ray, yellow, heavy,Sets on the dahlias' bright bouquet,And I can hear viols playing,A clavichord's rare display. 3 Add  Evening Room to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
