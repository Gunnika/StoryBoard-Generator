We climbed Yoyang Tower withall the scene around cominginto vision; looking up theGreat River seeing boats turnand enter the Tungting Lake; geesecrying farewell to the riveras they flew south; evening fallingas if mountain tops upt up the moonwith their lips; and we in the YoyangTower as if with heads amongstthe cloud, drinking wine as if the cupscame from heaven itself; thenhaving drunk our fill there blewa cold wind filling out oursleeves, it seeming as thoughwe were dancing in time with it. 6 Add  Going Up Yoyang Tower to your library.Return to the Li Bai library, or . . .
