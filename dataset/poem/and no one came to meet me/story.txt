...And no-one came to meet meCarrying a lantern.The house quiet: my entryBy moonlight uncertain.Under the green lamp,His smile was lifeless,Whispering: 'Cinderella,How strange your voice...'Flames of the fire dying:Wearily, cricket chirping.Ah! Someone's taken myWhite shoe into their keeping.Given me three carnationsWithout raising their eyes.O, dear tokens,Where can you hide?My heart's bitter tooKnowing soon, soon,My little white shoeWill be tried by everyone. 6.3 Add  '...And no-one came to meet me' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
