The living is a passing traveler;The dead, a man come home.One brief journey betwixt heaven and earth,Then, alas! we are the same old dust of ten thousand ages.The rabbit in the moon pounds the medicine in vain;Fu-sang, the tree of immortality, has crumbled to kindling wood.Man dies, his white bones are dumb without a wordWhen the green pines feel the coming of the spring.Looking back, I sigh; looking before, I sigh again.What is there to prize in the life's vaporous glory? 7.5 Add  The Old Dust to your library.Return to the Li Bai library, or . . .
