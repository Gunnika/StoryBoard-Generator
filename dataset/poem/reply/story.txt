For Vasily KomarovskySuch strange wordsThat quiet April day brought me.You knew it was still alive in me,That dreadful week of passion.I heard no pealing of bells,Floating in clear azure,For seven days copper laughter chimed,Silvery sorrow streamed.And I, veiling my face,As if for eternal parting,Lay, awaiting thereThe still-nameless torment. 3 Add  Reply to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
