My friend lives high on East Mountain.His nature is to love the hills and gorges.In green spring he sleeps in empty woodland,Still there when the noon sun brightens.Pine-tree winds to dust his hair.Rock-filled streams to cleanse his senses.Free of all sound and stress,Resting on a wedge of cloud and mist. 6 Add  Lines For A Taoist Adept to your library.Return to the Li Bai library, or . . .
