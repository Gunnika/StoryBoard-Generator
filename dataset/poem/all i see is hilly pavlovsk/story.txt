All I see is hilly Pavlovsk,Meadow around, motionless water,The most languid, the most shaded,Most unforgettable spot.When you drive through the gates,A blessed tremor takes you,Not just living, you're mad, exultant,Or alive in a different way.In late autumn it's fresh and biting,Wandering breezes, joyful solitude.Frosted white, the black fir-treesStanding in melting snow.And filled with fiery delirium,The dear voice rings out in song,On the lyre-player's bronze shoulder,Sits a bird with a scarlet breast. 3.5 Add  'All I see is hilly Pavlovsk,' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
