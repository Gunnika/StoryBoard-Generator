Like a white stone in a well's depths,A single memory remains to me,That I can't, won't fight against:It's happiness â€“ and misery.Ithink someone who gazed fullIn my eyes, would see it straight.They'd be sad, be thoughtful,As if hearing a mournful tale.I know the gods changed peopleTo things, yet left consciousness free.To keep suffering's wonder alive,In memory, you changed into me. 5.3 Add  'Like a white stone in a well's depths,' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
