Amongst bubbling streamsa dog barks; peach blossomis heavy with dew; hereand there a deer canbe seen in forest glades!No sound of the mid-daybell enters this fastnesswhere blue mist risesfrom bamboo groves;down from a high peakhangs a waterfall;non knows where he has gone, so sadly I rest,with my back leaningagainst a pine. 6 Add  Visiting A Taoist On Tiatien Mountain to your library.Return to the Li Bai library, or . . .
