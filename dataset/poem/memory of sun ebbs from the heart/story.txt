Memory of sun ebbs from the heart.Grass fades early.Wind blows the first snowflakesBarely, barely.Freezing water can't flowAlong these narrow channels.Nothing happens here, ohNothing can happen.A willow against the skySpreads its transparent fan.Better perhaps, if IHadn't accepted your hand.Memory of sunlight ebbs from the heart.What's this? Darkness?Perhaps! ...In the nightWinter has overcome us. 5.7 Add  'Memory of sun ebbs from the heart.' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
