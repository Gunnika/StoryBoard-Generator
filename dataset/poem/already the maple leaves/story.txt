Already the maple leavesCover the swans' pool,And the blood-stained armsOf late-ripening rowan.And, dazzlingly slender,Crossed legs impervious to cold,She sits on a northern stone,And gazes at the road.Ifelt a vague fear,In front of this famous girl.Rays of thinning lightPlaying over her shoulders.And how could I forgive herYour delight, your enamoured praiseâ€¦Look there, elegantly naked,It's a joy to her to be sad. 7 Add  'Already the maple leaves' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
