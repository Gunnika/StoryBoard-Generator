Don't taunt your heart with earthly joys,Don't cleave to your wife and home,Take the bread from your child's mouth,So you can give it to a stranger.Be the humblest servant of the manWho was your bitterest enemy,Call the woodland creatures kin,And don't ask God for anything. 8 Add  'Don't taunt your heart with earthly joys,' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
