In the garden strains of music,Full of inexpressible sadness.Scent of the sea, pungent, fresh,On an ice bed, a dish of oysters.He said to me: 'I'm a true friend!'And then touched my dress.How unlike an embraceThe closeness of his caress.Thus, you stroke birds or cats, yes,Thus you view shapely performers…In his calm eyes only laughter,Beneath pale-gold eyelashes.And the voices of sad violsSang behind drifting vapour:'Give thanks to heaven, then –You're alone at last with your lover.' 5.5 Add  Evening to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
