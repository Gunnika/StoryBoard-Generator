See the waters of the Yellow River leap down from Heaven, Roll away to the deep sea and never turn again! See at the mirrorin the High Hall Aged men bewailing white locks - In the morning, threads of silk, In the evening flakes of snow. Snatch the joysof life as they come and use them to the full; Do not leave the silver cup idly glinting at the moon. The things that Heaven madeMan was meant to use; A thousand guilders scattered to the wind may come back again. Roast mutton and sliced beef will onlytaste well If you drink with them at one sitting three hundred cups. Great Master Ts'Ãªen, Doctor Tan-ch'iu, Here is wine, do notstop drinking But listen, please, and I will sing you a song. Bells and drums and fine food, what are they to me Who only wantto get drunk and never again be sober? The Saints and Sages of old times are all stock and still, Only the might drinkers of winehave left a name behind. When the prince of Ch'Ãªen gave a feast in the Palace of P'ing-lo With twenty thousand gallons of winehe loosed mirth and play. The master of the feast must not cry that his money is all spent; Let him send to the tavern and fetchwine to keep our tankards filled. His five-flower horse and thousand-guilder coat - Let him call the boy to take them along andpawn them for good wine, That drinking together we may drive away the sorrows of a thousand years. 7 Add  Chiang Chin Chiu to your library.Return to the Li Bai library, or . . .
