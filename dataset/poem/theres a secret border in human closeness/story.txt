For Nikolai NedobrovoThere's a secret border in human closeness,That love's being, love's passion, cannot pass –Though lips are sealed together in dreadful silence,Though hearts break in two with love's distress.And friendship too is powerless, and yearsOf sublime flame-filled happiness,When the soul itself is free, a stranger,To the slow languor of sensuality.Those who try to reach that boundary are mad,And those who have – are filled with anguish.Now you know, now you understand,Why my heart won't beat at your caress. 6.8 Add  'There's a secret border in human closeness,' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
