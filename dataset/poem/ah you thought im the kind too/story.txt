Ah! You thought I'm the kind too,To cry 'how could you forget me',And praying and sobbing, throw myselfUnder the horses' hooves.Or that I'd ask the sorceressFor some enchanted root in water,And send you a fatal gift –My secretly-scented handkerchief.I'd rather be damned. Not a look or sighWill reach your accursed soul,But I swear by the angelic garden,I swear by the miraculous icon,And by our nights of fiery passion –I'll never return to you. 7.8 Add  'Ah!
