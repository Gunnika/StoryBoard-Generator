I came here, in idleness.Where I'm bored: all the same to me!A sleepy hilltop mill, yes,Here years pass silently.Over convolvulus gone dryThe bee swims past, ahead,I call to that mermaid byThe pond: the mermaid's dead.Thick with mud, and rusted,The wide pond's shallows:Over the trembling aspenA weightless moon glows.Isee everything freshly.The poplars smell moist.I'm silent. Silent, readyTo be yours again, earth. 6.5 Add  'I came here, in idleness.' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
