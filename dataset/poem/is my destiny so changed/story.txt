For Yunia AnrepIs my destiny so changed,Or the game really over?Where are those winters I'd go to bedAt six in the morning?Newly tranquil and severe,I'm living on a wild coastline,No longer able to utterA single kind or idle word.Can Christmas soon be here?The steppe is touchingly green.The sun glows. Lapping the shoreThere's a warm-looking wave.When tired, languid from happiness,I used to dream of such quiet,With unutterable wonder,And thus I imagined myself,A posthumous, wandering soul. 7.4 Add  'Is my destiny so changed,' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
