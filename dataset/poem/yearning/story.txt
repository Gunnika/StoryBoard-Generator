Misted the flowers weep as light diesMoon of white silk sleeplessly cries.Stilled - Phoenix wings.Touched - Mandarin strings.This song tells secrets that no one knowsTo far Yenjan on Spring breeze it goes.To you it flies Through the night skies.Sidelong - Eyes. HowWhite tears fill now!Heart's pain? Come see -In this mirror with me. 6.5 Add  Yearning to your library.Return to the Li Bai library, or . . .
