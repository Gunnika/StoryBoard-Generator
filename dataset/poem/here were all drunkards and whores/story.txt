Here we're all drunkards and whores,Joylessly stuck together!On the walls, birds and flowersPine for the clouds and air.The smoke from your black pipeMakes strange vapours rise.The skirt I wear is tight,Revealing my slim thighs.Windows tightly closed:Who's there, frost or thunder?Your eyes, are they thoseOf some cautious cat, I wonder?O, my heart how you yearn!Is it for death you wait?Or that girl, dancing there,For hell to be her sure fate? 6.9 Add  'Here we're all drunkards and whores,' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
