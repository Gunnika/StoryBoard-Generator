A string of little beads at my neck,In a broad muff I hide my hands,The eyes stare vacantly,They never shed a tear.And the face appears pale,Against the lavender silk,My straight bangsAlmost reach my eyebrows.And how dissimilar to flightIs my halting step,As if it were a raft beneath my feet,Not these wooden parquet squares.And the pale lips are slightly parted,The breathing laboured and uneven,And over my heart trembleThe flowers of a non-existent meeting. 6.5 Add  'A string of little beads at my neck,' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
