Gold vessels of fine wines,thousands a gallon,Jade dishes of rare meats,costing more thousands,I lay my chopsticks down,no more can banquet,I draw my sword and starewildly about me:Ice bars my way to crossthe Yellow River,Snows from dark skies to climbthe T'ai-hang mountains!At peace I drop a hookinto a brooklet,At once I'm in a boatbut sailing sunward...(Hard is the journey,Hard is the journey,So many turnings,And now where am I?)So when a breeze breaks waves,bringing fair weather,I set a cloud for sails,cross the blue oceans! 6 Add  Hard is the Journey to your library.Return to the Li Bai library, or . . .
