I've written down the wordsThat I've not dared to speak.My body's strangely dumb.Dully my head beats.The horn cries have died.The heart's still confused.On the croquet lawn, lightAutumn snowflakes fused.Let the last leaves rustle!Let last thoughts torment!I don't wish to troubleThose used to happiness.Iforgive those lips, eyesOf yours, their cruel jestâ€¦Oh, tomorrow we'll rideThat first wintry sledge.Drawing-room candles will glowMore tenderly in the day.Of conservatory roses,I'll bring a whole bouquet. 6.5 Add  'I've written down the words' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
