As down Mount Emerald at eve I came,The mountain moon went all the way with me.Backward I looked, to see the heights aflameWith a pale light that glimmered eerily.A little lad undid the rustic latchAs hand in hand your cottage we did gain,Where green limp tendrils at our cloaks did catch,And dim bamboos o'erhung a shadowy lane.Gaily I cried, "Here may we rest our fill!"Then choicest wines we quaffed; and cheerily"The Wind among the Pines" we sang, untilA few faint stars hung in the Galaxy.Merry were you, my friend: and drunk was I,Blissfully letting all the world go by. 7 Add  Down from the Mountain to your library.Return to the Li Bai library, or . . .
