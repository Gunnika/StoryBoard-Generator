Give me comfortless seasons of sickness,Visitations of wrath and of wrongOn my house; Lord, take child and companion,And destroy the sweet power of song.Thus I pray at each matins, each vespers,After these many wearying days,That the storm-cloud which broods over RussiaMay be changed to a nimbus ablaze. 7.7 Add  Prayer to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
