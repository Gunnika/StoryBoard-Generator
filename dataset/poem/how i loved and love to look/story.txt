How I loved, and love, to lookAt your chained shores,At the balconies on which centuriesNever set foot.And you are truly the capital,For we who are mad and luminous;But when those pure and special hoursLinger above the Neva,And the wind in May sweeps roundThe columns that edge the water,You are like a sinner seeing, before death,A sweetest dream of paradise. 5.6 Add  'How I loved, and love, to look' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
