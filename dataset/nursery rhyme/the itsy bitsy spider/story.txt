Lyrics and finger play instructions: The itsy bitsy spider climbed up the waterspout [alternately touch the thumb of one hand to the index finger of the other]Down came the rain [with both hands held high, wiggle and move downward to mimic rain falling]and washed the spider out [sweep the hands from side to side and make a "swoosh" noise]Out came the sun [raise both hands above head and touch to form a circle for the sun]and dried up all the rain [wiggle fingers and move upwards]and the itsy bitsy spider climbed up the spout again. [alternately touch the thumb of one hand to index finger of the other]Featured in our Pre-K Wordplay! to inspire beginner readers.
