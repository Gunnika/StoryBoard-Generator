A Dog had learned to carry his master's dinner to him every day.He was very faithful to his duty, though the smell of the goodthings in the basket tempted him. The Dogs in the neighborhood noticed him carrying the basket andsoon discovered what was in it. They made several attempts tosteal it from him. But he always guarded it faithfully. Then one day all the Dogs in the neighborhood got together andmet him on his way with the basket. The Dog tried to run awayfrom them. But at last he stopped to argue. That was his mistake. They soon made him feel so ridiculous thathe dropped the basket and seized a large piece of roast meatintended for his master's dinner. "Very well," he said, "you divide the rest." Do not stop to argue with temptation. 7.4 Add  The Dog And His Masters Dinner to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
