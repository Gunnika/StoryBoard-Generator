An Ass was feeding in a pasture near a wood when he saw a Wolflurking in the shadows along the hedge. He easily guessed whatthe Wolf had in mind, and thought of a plan to save himself. Sohe pretended he was lame, and began to hobble painfully. When the Wolf came up, he asked the Ass what had made him lame,and the Ass replied that he had stepped on a sharp thorn. "Please pull it out," he pleaded, groaning as if in pain. "If youdo not, it might stick in your throat when you eat me." The Wolf saw the wisdom of the advice, for he wanted to enjoy hismeal without any danger of choking. So the Ass lifted up his footand the Wolf began to search very closely and carefully for thethorn. Just then the Ass kicked out with all his might, tumbling theWolf a dozen paces away. And while the Wolf was getting veryslowly and painfully to his feet, the Ass galloped away insafety. "Serves me right," growled the Wolf as he crept into the bushes."I'm a butcher by trade, not a doctor." Stick to your trade. 9.4 Add  The Wolf And The Ass to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
