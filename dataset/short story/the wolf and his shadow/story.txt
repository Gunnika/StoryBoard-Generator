A Wolf left his lair one evening in fine spirits and an excellentappetite. As he ran, the setting sun cast his shadow far out onthe ground, and it looked as if the wolf were a hundred timesbigger than he really was. "Why," exclaimed the Wolf proudly, "see how big I am! Fancy merunning away from a puny Lion! I'll show him who is fit to beking, he or I." Just then an immense shadow blotted him out entirely, and thenext instant a Lion struck him down with a single blow. Do not let your fancy make you forget realities. 8.7 Add  The Wolf And His Shadow to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
