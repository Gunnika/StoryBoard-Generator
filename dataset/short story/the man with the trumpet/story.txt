I stated it as definitely as I could. I was in a room with them. They had tongues like me, and hair and eyes. I got up out of my chair and said it as definitely as I could. Their eyes wavered. Something slipped out of their grasp. Had I been white and strong and young enough I might have plunged through walls, gone outward into nights and days, gone into prairies, into distances-- gone outward to the doorstep of the house of God, gone to God's throne room with their hands in mine. What I am trying to say is this-- By God I made their minds flee out of them. Their minds came out of them as clear and straight as anything could be. I said they might build temples to their lives. I threw my words at faces floating in a street. I threw my words like stones, like building stones. I scattered words in alleyways like seeds. I crept at night and threw my words in empty rooms of houses in a street. I said that life was life, that men in streets and cities might build temples to their souls. I whispered words at night into a telephone. I told my people life was sweet, that men might live. I said a million temples might be built, that doorsteps might be cleansed. At their fleeing harried minds I hurled a stone. I said they might build temples to themselves. 9.2 Add  The Man With The Trumpet to your library.Return to the Sherwood Anderson library, or . . .
