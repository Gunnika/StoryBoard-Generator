"Where now?" said Frederick Williams to his friend Charles Lawson,on entering his own office and finding the latter, carpet-bag inhand, awaiting his arrival."Off for a day or two on a little business affair," replied Lawson."Business! What have you to do with business?""Not ordinary, vulgar business," returned Lawson with a slight tossof the head and an expression of contempt."Oh! It's of a peculiar nature?""It is--very peculiar; and, moreover, I want the good offices of afriend, to enable me the more certainly to accomplish my purposes.""Come! sit down and explain yourself," said Williams."Haven't a moment to spare. The boat goes in half an hour.""What boat?""The New Haven boat. So come, go along with me to the slip, andwe'll talk the matter over by the way.""I'm all attention," said Williams, as the two young men steppedforth upon the pavement."Well, you must know," began Lawson, "that I have a first rate loveaffair on my hands.""You!""Now don't smile; but hear me.""Go on--I'm all attention.""You know old Everett?""Thomas Everett, the silk importer?""The same.""I know something about him.""You know, I presume, that he has a pretty fair looking daughter?""And I know," replied Williams, "that when 'pretty fair looking' issaid, pretty much all is said in her favor.""Not by a great deal," was the decided answer of Lawson."Pray what is there beyond this that a man can call attractive?""Her father's money.""I didn't think of that.""Didn't you?""No. But it would take the saving influence of a pretty large sum togive her a marriageable merit in my eyes.""Gold hides a multitude of defects, you know, Fred.""It does; but it has to be heaped up very high to cover a wife'sdefects, if they be as radical as those in Caroline Everett. Why, tospeak out the plain, homespun truth, the girl's a fool!""She isn't over bright, Fred, I know," replied Lawson. "But to callher a fool, is to use rather a broad assertion.""She certainly hasn't good common sense. I would be ashamed of herin company a dozen times a day if she were any thing to me.""She's young, you know, Fred.""Yes, a young and silly girl.""Just silly enough for my purpose. But, she will grow older andwiser, you know. Young and silly is a very good fault.""Where is she now?""At a boarding school some thirty miles from New Haven. Do you knowwhy her father sent her there?""No.""She would meet me on her way to and from school while in the city,and the old gentleman had, I presume, some objections to me as ason-in-law.""And not without reason," replied Williams."I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with mywishes," continued Lawson. "Caroline told me where she was going,and I was not long in making a visit to the neighborhood. Greatattention is paid to physical development in the school, and theyoung ladies are required to walk, daily, in the open air, amid thebeautiful, romantic, and secluded scenery by which the place issurrounded. They walk alone, or in company, as suits their fancies.Caroline chose to walk alone when I was near at hand; and we met ina certain retired glen, where the sweet quiet of nature was brokenonly by the dreamy murmur of a silvery stream, and there we talkedof love. It is not in the heart of a woman to withstand a scene likethis. I told, in burning words, my passion, and she hearkened andwas won." Lawson paused for some moments; but, as Williams made noremark, he continued--"It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to amarriage. He is pence-proud, and I, as you know, am penniless.""I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law,"said Williams."I have the best of reasons, for knowing that he would not. He hasalready spoken of me to his daughter in very severe terms.""As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S.

Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "Business! What have you to do with business?""Not ordinary, vulgar business," returned Lawson with a slight tossof the head and an expression of contempt."Oh! It's of a peculiar nature?""It is--very peculiar; and, moreover, I want the good offices of afriend, to enable me the more certainly to accomplish my purposes.""Come! sit down and explain yourself," said Williams."Haven't a moment to spare. The boat goes in half an hour.""What boat?""The New Haven boat. So come, go along with me to the slip, andwe'll talk the matter over by the way.""I'm all attention," said Williams, as the two young men steppedforth upon the pavement."Well, you must know," began Lawson, "that I have a first rate loveaffair on my hands.""You!""Now don't smile; but hear me.""Go on--I'm all attention.""You know old Everett?""Thomas Everett, the silk importer?""The same.""I know something about him.""You know, I presume, that he has a pretty fair looking daughter?""And I know," replied Williams, "that when 'pretty fair looking' issaid, pretty much all is said in her favor.""Not by a great deal," was the decided answer of Lawson."Pray what is there beyond this that a man can call attractive?""Her father's money.""I didn't think of that.""Didn't you?""No. But it would take the saving influence of a pretty large sum togive her a marriageable merit in my eyes.""Gold hides a multitude of defects, you know, Fred.""It does; but it has to be heaped up very high to cover a wife'sdefects, if they be as radical as those in Caroline Everett. Why, tospeak out the plain, homespun truth, the girl's a fool!""She isn't over bright, Fred, I know," replied Lawson. "But to callher a fool, is to use rather a broad assertion.""She certainly hasn't good common sense. I would be ashamed of herin company a dozen times a day if she were any thing to me.""She's young, you know, Fred.""Yes, a young and silly girl.""Just silly enough for my purpose. But, she will grow older andwiser, you know. Young and silly is a very good fault.""Where is she now?""At a boarding school some thirty miles from New Haven. Do you knowwhy her father sent her there?""No.""She would meet me on her way to and from school while in the city,and the old gentleman had, I presume, some objections to me as ason-in-law.""And not without reason," replied Williams."I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with mywishes," continued Lawson. "Caroline told me where she was going,and I was not long in making a visit to the neighborhood. Greatattention is paid to physical development in the school, and theyoung ladies are required to walk, daily, in the open air, amid thebeautiful, romantic, and secluded scenery by which the place issurrounded. They walk alone, or in company, as suits their fancies.Caroline chose to walk alone when I was near at hand; and we met ina certain retired glen, where the sweet quiet of nature was brokenonly by the dreamy murmur of a silvery stream, and there we talkedof love. It is not in the heart of a woman to withstand a scene likethis. I told, in burning words, my passion, and she hearkened andwas won." Lawson paused for some moments; but, as Williams made noremark, he continued--"It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to amarriage. He is pence-proud, and I, as you know, am penniless.""I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law,"said Williams."I have the best of reasons, for knowing that he would not. He hasalready spoken of me to his daughter in very severe terms.""As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight.

"It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father.

Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "Oh! It's of a peculiar nature?""It is--very peculiar; and, moreover, I want the good offices of afriend, to enable me the more certainly to accomplish my purposes.""Come! sit down and explain yourself," said Williams."Haven't a moment to spare. The boat goes in half an hour.""What boat?""The New Haven boat. So come, go along with me to the slip, andwe'll talk the matter over by the way.""I'm all attention," said Williams, as the two young men steppedforth upon the pavement."Well, you must know," began Lawson, "that I have a first rate loveaffair on my hands.""You!""Now don't smile; but hear me.""Go on--I'm all attention.""You know old Everett?""Thomas Everett, the silk importer?""The same.""I know something about him.""You know, I presume, that he has a pretty fair looking daughter?""And I know," replied Williams, "that when 'pretty fair looking' issaid, pretty much all is said in her favor.""Not by a great deal," was the decided answer of Lawson."Pray what is there beyond this that a man can call attractive?""Her father's money.""I didn't think of that.""Didn't you?""No. But it would take the saving influence of a pretty large sum togive her a marriageable merit in my eyes.""Gold hides a multitude of defects, you know, Fred.""It does; but it has to be heaped up very high to cover a wife'sdefects, if they be as radical as those in Caroline Everett. Why, tospeak out the plain, homespun truth, the girl's a fool!""She isn't over bright, Fred, I know," replied Lawson. "But to callher a fool, is to use rather a broad assertion.""She certainly hasn't good common sense. I would be ashamed of herin company a dozen times a day if she were any thing to me.""She's young, you know, Fred.""Yes, a young and silly girl.""Just silly enough for my purpose. But, she will grow older andwiser, you know. Young and silly is a very good fault.""Where is she now?""At a boarding school some thirty miles from New Haven. Do you knowwhy her father sent her there?""No.""She would meet me on her way to and from school while in the city,and the old gentleman had, I presume, some objections to me as ason-in-law.""And not without reason," replied Williams."I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with mywishes," continued Lawson. "Caroline told me where she was going,and I was not long in making a visit to the neighborhood. Greatattention is paid to physical development in the school, and theyoung ladies are required to walk, daily, in the open air, amid thebeautiful, romantic, and secluded scenery by which the place issurrounded. They walk alone, or in company, as suits their fancies.Caroline chose to walk alone when I was near at hand; and we met ina certain retired glen, where the sweet quiet of nature was brokenonly by the dreamy murmur of a silvery stream, and there we talkedof love. It is not in the heart of a woman to withstand a scene likethis. I told, in burning words, my passion, and she hearkened andwas won." Lawson paused for some moments; but, as Williams made noremark, he continued--"It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to amarriage. He is pence-proud, and I, as you know, am penniless.""I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law,"said Williams."I have the best of reasons, for knowing that he would not. He hasalready spoken of me to his daughter in very severe terms.""As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met.

Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S.

Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "It is--very peculiar; and, moreover, I want the good offices of afriend, to enable me the more certainly to accomplish my purposes.""Come! sit down and explain yourself," said Williams."Haven't a moment to spare. The boat goes in half an hour.""What boat?""The New Haven boat. So come, go along with me to the slip, andwe'll talk the matter over by the way.""I'm all attention," said Williams, as the two young men steppedforth upon the pavement."Well, you must know," began Lawson, "that I have a first rate loveaffair on my hands.""You!""Now don't smile; but hear me.""Go on--I'm all attention.""You know old Everett?""Thomas Everett, the silk importer?""The same.""I know something about him.""You know, I presume, that he has a pretty fair looking daughter?""And I know," replied Williams, "that when 'pretty fair looking' issaid, pretty much all is said in her favor.""Not by a great deal," was the decided answer of Lawson."Pray what is there beyond this that a man can call attractive?""Her father's money.""I didn't think of that.""Didn't you?""No. But it would take the saving influence of a pretty large sum togive her a marriageable merit in my eyes.""Gold hides a multitude of defects, you know, Fred.""It does; but it has to be heaped up very high to cover a wife'sdefects, if they be as radical as those in Caroline Everett. Why, tospeak out the plain, homespun truth, the girl's a fool!""She isn't over bright, Fred, I know," replied Lawson. "But to callher a fool, is to use rather a broad assertion.""She certainly hasn't good common sense. I would be ashamed of herin company a dozen times a day if she were any thing to me.""She's young, you know, Fred.""Yes, a young and silly girl.""Just silly enough for my purpose. But, she will grow older andwiser, you know. Young and silly is a very good fault.""Where is she now?""At a boarding school some thirty miles from New Haven. Do you knowwhy her father sent her there?""No.""She would meet me on her way to and from school while in the city,and the old gentleman had, I presume, some objections to me as ason-in-law.""And not without reason," replied Williams."I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with mywishes," continued Lawson. "Caroline told me where she was going,and I was not long in making a visit to the neighborhood. Greatattention is paid to physical development in the school, and theyoung ladies are required to walk, daily, in the open air, amid thebeautiful, romantic, and secluded scenery by which the place issurrounded. They walk alone, or in company, as suits their fancies.Caroline chose to walk alone when I was near at hand; and we met ina certain retired glen, where the sweet quiet of nature was brokenonly by the dreamy murmur of a silvery stream, and there we talkedof love. It is not in the heart of a woman to withstand a scene likethis. I told, in burning words, my passion, and she hearkened andwas won." Lawson paused for some moments; but, as Williams made noremark, he continued--"It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to amarriage. He is pence-proud, and I, as you know, am penniless.""I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law,"said Williams."I have the best of reasons, for knowing that he would not. He hasalready spoken of me to his daughter in very severe terms.""As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape!

His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "Haven't a moment to spare. The boat goes in half an hour.""What boat?""The New Haven boat. So come, go along with me to the slip, andwe'll talk the matter over by the way.""I'm all attention," said Williams, as the two young men steppedforth upon the pavement."Well, you must know," began Lawson, "that I have a first rate loveaffair on my hands.""You!""Now don't smile; but hear me.""Go on--I'm all attention.""You know old Everett?""Thomas Everett, the silk importer?""The same.""I know something about him.""You know, I presume, that he has a pretty fair looking daughter?""And I know," replied Williams, "that when 'pretty fair looking' issaid, pretty much all is said in her favor.""Not by a great deal," was the decided answer of Lawson."Pray what is there beyond this that a man can call attractive?""Her father's money.""I didn't think of that.""Didn't you?""No. But it would take the saving influence of a pretty large sum togive her a marriageable merit in my eyes.""Gold hides a multitude of defects, you know, Fred.""It does; but it has to be heaped up very high to cover a wife'sdefects, if they be as radical as those in Caroline Everett. Why, tospeak out the plain, homespun truth, the girl's a fool!""She isn't over bright, Fred, I know," replied Lawson. "But to callher a fool, is to use rather a broad assertion.""She certainly hasn't good common sense. I would be ashamed of herin company a dozen times a day if she were any thing to me.""She's young, you know, Fred.""Yes, a young and silly girl.""Just silly enough for my purpose. But, she will grow older andwiser, you know. Young and silly is a very good fault.""Where is she now?""At a boarding school some thirty miles from New Haven. Do you knowwhy her father sent her there?""No.""She would meet me on her way to and from school while in the city,and the old gentleman had, I presume, some objections to me as ason-in-law.""And not without reason," replied Williams."I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with mywishes," continued Lawson. "Caroline told me where she was going,and I was not long in making a visit to the neighborhood. Greatattention is paid to physical development in the school, and theyoung ladies are required to walk, daily, in the open air, amid thebeautiful, romantic, and secluded scenery by which the place issurrounded. They walk alone, or in company, as suits their fancies.Caroline chose to walk alone when I was near at hand; and we met ina certain retired glen, where the sweet quiet of nature was brokenonly by the dreamy murmur of a silvery stream, and there we talkedof love. It is not in the heart of a woman to withstand a scene likethis. I told, in burning words, my passion, and she hearkened andwas won." Lawson paused for some moments; but, as Williams made noremark, he continued--"It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to amarriage. He is pence-proud, and I, as you know, am penniless.""I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law,"said Williams."I have the best of reasons, for knowing that he would not. He hasalready spoken of me to his daughter in very severe terms.""As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime.

Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "The New Haven boat. So come, go along with me to the slip, andwe'll talk the matter over by the way.""I'm all attention," said Williams, as the two young men steppedforth upon the pavement."Well, you must know," began Lawson, "that I have a first rate loveaffair on my hands.""You!""Now don't smile; but hear me.""Go on--I'm all attention.""You know old Everett?""Thomas Everett, the silk importer?""The same.""I know something about him.""You know, I presume, that he has a pretty fair looking daughter?""And I know," replied Williams, "that when 'pretty fair looking' issaid, pretty much all is said in her favor.""Not by a great deal," was the decided answer of Lawson."Pray what is there beyond this that a man can call attractive?""Her father's money.""I didn't think of that.""Didn't you?""No. But it would take the saving influence of a pretty large sum togive her a marriageable merit in my eyes.""Gold hides a multitude of defects, you know, Fred.""It does; but it has to be heaped up very high to cover a wife'sdefects, if they be as radical as those in Caroline Everett. Why, tospeak out the plain, homespun truth, the girl's a fool!""She isn't over bright, Fred, I know," replied Lawson. "But to callher a fool, is to use rather a broad assertion.""She certainly hasn't good common sense. I would be ashamed of herin company a dozen times a day if she were any thing to me.""She's young, you know, Fred.""Yes, a young and silly girl.""Just silly enough for my purpose. But, she will grow older andwiser, you know. Young and silly is a very good fault.""Where is she now?""At a boarding school some thirty miles from New Haven. Do you knowwhy her father sent her there?""No.""She would meet me on her way to and from school while in the city,and the old gentleman had, I presume, some objections to me as ason-in-law.""And not without reason," replied Williams."I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with mywishes," continued Lawson. "Caroline told me where she was going,and I was not long in making a visit to the neighborhood. Greatattention is paid to physical development in the school, and theyoung ladies are required to walk, daily, in the open air, amid thebeautiful, romantic, and secluded scenery by which the place issurrounded. They walk alone, or in company, as suits their fancies.Caroline chose to walk alone when I was near at hand; and we met ina certain retired glen, where the sweet quiet of nature was brokenonly by the dreamy murmur of a silvery stream, and there we talkedof love. It is not in the heart of a woman to withstand a scene likethis. I told, in burning words, my passion, and she hearkened andwas won." Lawson paused for some moments; but, as Williams made noremark, he continued--"It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to amarriage. He is pence-proud, and I, as you know, am penniless.""I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law,"said Williams."I have the best of reasons, for knowing that he would not. He hasalready spoken of me to his daughter in very severe terms.""As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether.

Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S.

Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "I'm all attention," said Williams, as the two young men steppedforth upon the pavement."Well, you must know," began Lawson, "that I have a first rate loveaffair on my hands.""You!""Now don't smile; but hear me.""Go on--I'm all attention.""You know old Everett?""Thomas Everett, the silk importer?""The same.""I know something about him.""You know, I presume, that he has a pretty fair looking daughter?""And I know," replied Williams, "that when 'pretty fair looking' issaid, pretty much all is said in her favor.""Not by a great deal," was the decided answer of Lawson."Pray what is there beyond this that a man can call attractive?""Her father's money.""I didn't think of that.""Didn't you?""No. But it would take the saving influence of a pretty large sum togive her a marriageable merit in my eyes.""Gold hides a multitude of defects, you know, Fred.""It does; but it has to be heaped up very high to cover a wife'sdefects, if they be as radical as those in Caroline Everett. Why, tospeak out the plain, homespun truth, the girl's a fool!""She isn't over bright, Fred, I know," replied Lawson. "But to callher a fool, is to use rather a broad assertion.""She certainly hasn't good common sense. I would be ashamed of herin company a dozen times a day if she were any thing to me.""She's young, you know, Fred.""Yes, a young and silly girl.""Just silly enough for my purpose. But, she will grow older andwiser, you know. Young and silly is a very good fault.""Where is she now?""At a boarding school some thirty miles from New Haven. Do you knowwhy her father sent her there?""No.""She would meet me on her way to and from school while in the city,and the old gentleman had, I presume, some objections to me as ason-in-law.""And not without reason," replied Williams."I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with mywishes," continued Lawson. "Caroline told me where she was going,and I was not long in making a visit to the neighborhood. Greatattention is paid to physical development in the school, and theyoung ladies are required to walk, daily, in the open air, amid thebeautiful, romantic, and secluded scenery by which the place issurrounded. They walk alone, or in company, as suits their fancies.Caroline chose to walk alone when I was near at hand; and we met ina certain retired glen, where the sweet quiet of nature was brokenonly by the dreamy murmur of a silvery stream, and there we talkedof love. It is not in the heart of a woman to withstand a scene likethis. I told, in burning words, my passion, and she hearkened andwas won." Lawson paused for some moments; but, as Williams made noremark, he continued--"It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to amarriage. He is pence-proud, and I, as you know, am penniless.""I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law,"said Williams."I have the best of reasons, for knowing that he would not. He hasalready spoken of me to his daughter in very severe terms.""As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S.

Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "You!""Now don't smile; but hear me.""Go on--I'm all attention.""You know old Everett?""Thomas Everett, the silk importer?""The same.""I know something about him.""You know, I presume, that he has a pretty fair looking daughter?""And I know," replied Williams, "that when 'pretty fair looking' issaid, pretty much all is said in her favor.""Not by a great deal," was the decided answer of Lawson."Pray what is there beyond this that a man can call attractive?""Her father's money.""I didn't think of that.""Didn't you?""No. But it would take the saving influence of a pretty large sum togive her a marriageable merit in my eyes.""Gold hides a multitude of defects, you know, Fred.""It does; but it has to be heaped up very high to cover a wife'sdefects, if they be as radical as those in Caroline Everett. Why, tospeak out the plain, homespun truth, the girl's a fool!""She isn't over bright, Fred, I know," replied Lawson. "But to callher a fool, is to use rather a broad assertion.""She certainly hasn't good common sense. I would be ashamed of herin company a dozen times a day if she were any thing to me.""She's young, you know, Fred.""Yes, a young and silly girl.""Just silly enough for my purpose. But, she will grow older andwiser, you know. Young and silly is a very good fault.""Where is she now?""At a boarding school some thirty miles from New Haven. Do you knowwhy her father sent her there?""No.""She would meet me on her way to and from school while in the city,and the old gentleman had, I presume, some objections to me as ason-in-law.""And not without reason," replied Williams."I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with mywishes," continued Lawson. "Caroline told me where she was going,and I was not long in making a visit to the neighborhood. Greatattention is paid to physical development in the school, and theyoung ladies are required to walk, daily, in the open air, amid thebeautiful, romantic, and secluded scenery by which the place issurrounded. They walk alone, or in company, as suits their fancies.Caroline chose to walk alone when I was near at hand; and we met ina certain retired glen, where the sweet quiet of nature was brokenonly by the dreamy murmur of a silvery stream, and there we talkedof love. It is not in the heart of a woman to withstand a scene likethis. I told, in burning words, my passion, and she hearkened andwas won." Lawson paused for some moments; but, as Williams made noremark, he continued--"It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to amarriage. He is pence-proud, and I, as you know, am penniless.""I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law,"said Williams."I have the best of reasons, for knowing that he would not. He hasalready spoken of me to his daughter in very severe terms.""As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight.

Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "Go on--I'm all attention.""You know old Everett?""Thomas Everett, the silk importer?""The same.""I know something about him.""You know, I presume, that he has a pretty fair looking daughter?""And I know," replied Williams, "that when 'pretty fair looking' issaid, pretty much all is said in her favor.""Not by a great deal," was the decided answer of Lawson."Pray what is there beyond this that a man can call attractive?""Her father's money.""I didn't think of that.""Didn't you?""No. But it would take the saving influence of a pretty large sum togive her a marriageable merit in my eyes.""Gold hides a multitude of defects, you know, Fred.""It does; but it has to be heaped up very high to cover a wife'sdefects, if they be as radical as those in Caroline Everett. Why, tospeak out the plain, homespun truth, the girl's a fool!""She isn't over bright, Fred, I know," replied Lawson. "But to callher a fool, is to use rather a broad assertion.""She certainly hasn't good common sense. I would be ashamed of herin company a dozen times a day if she were any thing to me.""She's young, you know, Fred.""Yes, a young and silly girl.""Just silly enough for my purpose. But, she will grow older andwiser, you know. Young and silly is a very good fault.""Where is she now?""At a boarding school some thirty miles from New Haven. Do you knowwhy her father sent her there?""No.""She would meet me on her way to and from school while in the city,and the old gentleman had, I presume, some objections to me as ason-in-law.""And not without reason," replied Williams."I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with mywishes," continued Lawson. "Caroline told me where she was going,and I was not long in making a visit to the neighborhood. Greatattention is paid to physical development in the school, and theyoung ladies are required to walk, daily, in the open air, amid thebeautiful, romantic, and secluded scenery by which the place issurrounded. They walk alone, or in company, as suits their fancies.Caroline chose to walk alone when I was near at hand; and we met ina certain retired glen, where the sweet quiet of nature was brokenonly by the dreamy murmur of a silvery stream, and there we talkedof love. It is not in the heart of a woman to withstand a scene likethis. I told, in burning words, my passion, and she hearkened andwas won." Lawson paused for some moments; but, as Williams made noremark, he continued--"It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to amarriage. He is pence-proud, and I, as you know, am penniless.""I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law,"said Williams."I have the best of reasons, for knowing that he would not. He hasalready spoken of me to his daughter in very severe terms.""As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished.

Do you knowwhy her father sent her there?""No.""She would meet me on her way to and from school while in the city,and the old gentleman had, I presume, some objections to me as ason-in-law.""And not without reason," replied Williams."I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with mywishes," continued Lawson. "Caroline told me where she was going,and I was not long in making a visit to the neighborhood. Greatattention is paid to physical development in the school, and theyoung ladies are required to walk, daily, in the open air, amid thebeautiful, romantic, and secluded scenery by which the place issurrounded. They walk alone, or in company, as suits their fancies.Caroline chose to walk alone when I was near at hand; and we met ina certain retired glen, where the sweet quiet of nature was brokenonly by the dreamy murmur of a silvery stream, and there we talkedof love. It is not in the heart of a woman to withstand a scene likethis. I told, in burning words, my passion, and she hearkened andwas won." Lawson paused for some moments; but, as Williams made noremark, he continued--"It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to amarriage. He is pence-proud, and I, as you know, am penniless.""I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law,"said Williams."I have the best of reasons, for knowing that he would not. He hasalready spoken of me to his daughter in very severe terms.""As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "Thomas Everett, the silk importer?""The same.""I know something about him.""You know, I presume, that he has a pretty fair looking daughter?""And I know," replied Williams, "that when 'pretty fair looking' issaid, pretty much all is said in her favor.""Not by a great deal," was the decided answer of Lawson."Pray what is there beyond this that a man can call attractive?""Her father's money.""I didn't think of that.""Didn't you?""No. But it would take the saving influence of a pretty large sum togive her a marriageable merit in my eyes.""Gold hides a multitude of defects, you know, Fred.""It does; but it has to be heaped up very high to cover a wife'sdefects, if they be as radical as those in Caroline Everett. Why, tospeak out the plain, homespun truth, the girl's a fool!""She isn't over bright, Fred, I know," replied Lawson. "But to callher a fool, is to use rather a broad assertion.""She certainly hasn't good common sense. I would be ashamed of herin company a dozen times a day if she were any thing to me.""She's young, you know, Fred.""Yes, a young and silly girl.""Just silly enough for my purpose. But, she will grow older andwiser, you know. Young and silly is a very good fault.""Where is she now?""At a boarding school some thirty miles from New Haven. Do you knowwhy her father sent her there?""No.""She would meet me on her way to and from school while in the city,and the old gentleman had, I presume, some objections to me as ason-in-law.""And not without reason," replied Williams."I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with mywishes," continued Lawson.

At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "The same.""I know something about him.""You know, I presume, that he has a pretty fair looking daughter?""And I know," replied Williams, "that when 'pretty fair looking' issaid, pretty much all is said in her favor.""Not by a great deal," was the decided answer of Lawson."Pray what is there beyond this that a man can call attractive?""Her father's money.""I didn't think of that.""Didn't you?""No. But it would take the saving influence of a pretty large sum togive her a marriageable merit in my eyes.""Gold hides a multitude of defects, you know, Fred.""It does; but it has to be heaped up very high to cover a wife'sdefects, if they be as radical as those in Caroline Everett. Why, tospeak out the plain, homespun truth, the girl's a fool!""She isn't over bright, Fred, I know," replied Lawson. "But to callher a fool, is to use rather a broad assertion.""She certainly hasn't good common sense. I would be ashamed of herin company a dozen times a day if she were any thing to me.""She's young, you know, Fred.""Yes, a young and silly girl.""Just silly enough for my purpose. But, she will grow older andwiser, you know. Young and silly is a very good fault.""Where is she now?""At a boarding school some thirty miles from New Haven. Do you knowwhy her father sent her there?""No.""She would meet me on her way to and from school while in the city,and the old gentleman had, I presume, some objections to me as ason-in-law.""And not without reason," replied Williams."I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with mywishes," continued Lawson. "Caroline told me where she was going,and I was not long in making a visit to the neighborhood. Greatattention is paid to physical development in the school, and theyoung ladies are required to walk, daily, in the open air, amid thebeautiful, romantic, and secluded scenery by which the place issurrounded. They walk alone, or in company, as suits their fancies.Caroline chose to walk alone when I was near at hand; and we met ina certain retired glen, where the sweet quiet of nature was brokenonly by the dreamy murmur of a silvery stream, and there we talkedof love. It is not in the heart of a woman to withstand a scene likethis. I told, in burning words, my passion, and she hearkened andwas won." Lawson paused for some moments; but, as Williams made noremark, he continued--"It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to amarriage. He is pence-proud, and I, as you know, am penniless.""I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law,"said Williams."I have the best of reasons, for knowing that he would not. He hasalready spoken of me to his daughter in very severe terms.""As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service.

On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "You know, I presume, that he has a pretty fair looking daughter?""And I know," replied Williams, "that when 'pretty fair looking' issaid, pretty much all is said in her favor.""Not by a great deal," was the decided answer of Lawson."Pray what is there beyond this that a man can call attractive?""Her father's money.""I didn't think of that.""Didn't you?""No. But it would take the saving influence of a pretty large sum togive her a marriageable merit in my eyes.""Gold hides a multitude of defects, you know, Fred.""It does; but it has to be heaped up very high to cover a wife'sdefects, if they be as radical as those in Caroline Everett. Why, tospeak out the plain, homespun truth, the girl's a fool!""She isn't over bright, Fred, I know," replied Lawson. "But to callher a fool, is to use rather a broad assertion.""She certainly hasn't good common sense. I would be ashamed of herin company a dozen times a day if she were any thing to me.""She's young, you know, Fred.""Yes, a young and silly girl.""Just silly enough for my purpose. But, she will grow older andwiser, you know. Young and silly is a very good fault.""Where is she now?""At a boarding school some thirty miles from New Haven. Do you knowwhy her father sent her there?""No.""She would meet me on her way to and from school while in the city,and the old gentleman had, I presume, some objections to me as ason-in-law.""And not without reason," replied Williams."I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with mywishes," continued Lawson. "Caroline told me where she was going,and I was not long in making a visit to the neighborhood. Greatattention is paid to physical development in the school, and theyoung ladies are required to walk, daily, in the open air, amid thebeautiful, romantic, and secluded scenery by which the place issurrounded. They walk alone, or in company, as suits their fancies.Caroline chose to walk alone when I was near at hand; and we met ina certain retired glen, where the sweet quiet of nature was brokenonly by the dreamy murmur of a silvery stream, and there we talkedof love. It is not in the heart of a woman to withstand a scene likethis. I told, in burning words, my passion, and she hearkened andwas won." Lawson paused for some moments; but, as Williams made noremark, he continued--"It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to amarriage. He is pence-proud, and I, as you know, am penniless.""I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law,"said Williams."I have the best of reasons, for knowing that he would not. He hasalready spoken of me to his daughter in very severe terms.""As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough.

And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "Not by a great deal," was the decided answer of Lawson."Pray what is there beyond this that a man can call attractive?""Her father's money.""I didn't think of that.""Didn't you?""No. But it would take the saving influence of a pretty large sum togive her a marriageable merit in my eyes.""Gold hides a multitude of defects, you know, Fred.""It does; but it has to be heaped up very high to cover a wife'sdefects, if they be as radical as those in Caroline Everett. Why, tospeak out the plain, homespun truth, the girl's a fool!""She isn't over bright, Fred, I know," replied Lawson. "But to callher a fool, is to use rather a broad assertion.""She certainly hasn't good common sense. I would be ashamed of herin company a dozen times a day if she were any thing to me.""She's young, you know, Fred.""Yes, a young and silly girl.""Just silly enough for my purpose. But, she will grow older andwiser, you know. Young and silly is a very good fault.""Where is she now?""At a boarding school some thirty miles from New Haven. Do you knowwhy her father sent her there?""No.""She would meet me on her way to and from school while in the city,and the old gentleman had, I presume, some objections to me as ason-in-law.""And not without reason," replied Williams."I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with mywishes," continued Lawson. "Caroline told me where she was going,and I was not long in making a visit to the neighborhood. Greatattention is paid to physical development in the school, and theyoung ladies are required to walk, daily, in the open air, amid thebeautiful, romantic, and secluded scenery by which the place issurrounded. They walk alone, or in company, as suits their fancies.Caroline chose to walk alone when I was near at hand; and we met ina certain retired glen, where the sweet quiet of nature was brokenonly by the dreamy murmur of a silvery stream, and there we talkedof love. It is not in the heart of a woman to withstand a scene likethis. I told, in burning words, my passion, and she hearkened andwas won." Lawson paused for some moments; but, as Williams made noremark, he continued--"It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to amarriage. He is pence-proud, and I, as you know, am penniless.""I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law,"said Williams."I have the best of reasons, for knowing that he would not. He hasalready spoken of me to his daughter in very severe terms.""As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions.

"Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes.

Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "Pray what is there beyond this that a man can call attractive?""Her father's money.""I didn't think of that.""Didn't you?""No. But it would take the saving influence of a pretty large sum togive her a marriageable merit in my eyes.""Gold hides a multitude of defects, you know, Fred.""It does; but it has to be heaped up very high to cover a wife'sdefects, if they be as radical as those in Caroline Everett. Why, tospeak out the plain, homespun truth, the girl's a fool!""She isn't over bright, Fred, I know," replied Lawson. "But to callher a fool, is to use rather a broad assertion.""She certainly hasn't good common sense. I would be ashamed of herin company a dozen times a day if she were any thing to me.""She's young, you know, Fred.""Yes, a young and silly girl.""Just silly enough for my purpose. But, she will grow older andwiser, you know. Young and silly is a very good fault.""Where is she now?""At a boarding school some thirty miles from New Haven. Do you knowwhy her father sent her there?""No.""She would meet me on her way to and from school while in the city,and the old gentleman had, I presume, some objections to me as ason-in-law.""And not without reason," replied Williams."I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with mywishes," continued Lawson. "Caroline told me where she was going,and I was not long in making a visit to the neighborhood. Greatattention is paid to physical development in the school, and theyoung ladies are required to walk, daily, in the open air, amid thebeautiful, romantic, and secluded scenery by which the place issurrounded. They walk alone, or in company, as suits their fancies.Caroline chose to walk alone when I was near at hand; and we met ina certain retired glen, where the sweet quiet of nature was brokenonly by the dreamy murmur of a silvery stream, and there we talkedof love. It is not in the heart of a woman to withstand a scene likethis. I told, in burning words, my passion, and she hearkened andwas won." Lawson paused for some moments; but, as Williams made noremark, he continued--"It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to amarriage. He is pence-proud, and I, as you know, am penniless.""I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law,"said Williams."I have the best of reasons, for knowing that he would not. He hasalready spoken of me to his daughter in very severe terms.""As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S.

During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "I didn't think of that.""Didn't you?""No. But it would take the saving influence of a pretty large sum togive her a marriageable merit in my eyes.""Gold hides a multitude of defects, you know, Fred.""It does; but it has to be heaped up very high to cover a wife'sdefects, if they be as radical as those in Caroline Everett. Why, tospeak out the plain, homespun truth, the girl's a fool!""She isn't over bright, Fred, I know," replied Lawson. "But to callher a fool, is to use rather a broad assertion.""She certainly hasn't good common sense. I would be ashamed of herin company a dozen times a day if she were any thing to me.""She's young, you know, Fred.""Yes, a young and silly girl.""Just silly enough for my purpose. But, she will grow older andwiser, you know. Young and silly is a very good fault.""Where is she now?""At a boarding school some thirty miles from New Haven. Do you knowwhy her father sent her there?""No.""She would meet me on her way to and from school while in the city,and the old gentleman had, I presume, some objections to me as ason-in-law.""And not without reason," replied Williams."I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with mywishes," continued Lawson. "Caroline told me where she was going,and I was not long in making a visit to the neighborhood. Greatattention is paid to physical development in the school, and theyoung ladies are required to walk, daily, in the open air, amid thebeautiful, romantic, and secluded scenery by which the place issurrounded. They walk alone, or in company, as suits their fancies.Caroline chose to walk alone when I was near at hand; and we met ina certain retired glen, where the sweet quiet of nature was brokenonly by the dreamy murmur of a silvery stream, and there we talkedof love. It is not in the heart of a woman to withstand a scene likethis. I told, in burning words, my passion, and she hearkened andwas won." Lawson paused for some moments; but, as Williams made noremark, he continued--"It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to amarriage. He is pence-proud, and I, as you know, am penniless.""I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law,"said Williams."I have the best of reasons, for knowing that he would not. He hasalready spoken of me to his daughter in very severe terms.""As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit.

Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service.

Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S.

Why, tospeak out the plain, homespun truth, the girl's a fool!""She isn't over bright, Fred, I know," replied Lawson. "But to callher a fool, is to use rather a broad assertion.""She certainly hasn't good common sense. I would be ashamed of herin company a dozen times a day if she were any thing to me.""She's young, you know, Fred.""Yes, a young and silly girl.""Just silly enough for my purpose. But, she will grow older andwiser, you know. Young and silly is a very good fault.""Where is she now?""At a boarding school some thirty miles from New Haven. Do you knowwhy her father sent her there?""No.""She would meet me on her way to and from school while in the city,and the old gentleman had, I presume, some objections to me as ason-in-law.""And not without reason," replied Williams."I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with mywishes," continued Lawson. "Caroline told me where she was going,and I was not long in making a visit to the neighborhood. Greatattention is paid to physical development in the school, and theyoung ladies are required to walk, daily, in the open air, amid thebeautiful, romantic, and secluded scenery by which the place issurrounded. They walk alone, or in company, as suits their fancies.Caroline chose to walk alone when I was near at hand; and we met ina certain retired glen, where the sweet quiet of nature was brokenonly by the dreamy murmur of a silvery stream, and there we talkedof love. It is not in the heart of a woman to withstand a scene likethis. I told, in burning words, my passion, and she hearkened andwas won." Lawson paused for some moments; but, as Williams made noremark, he continued--"It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to amarriage. He is pence-proud, and I, as you know, am penniless.""I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law,"said Williams."I have the best of reasons, for knowing that he would not. He hasalready spoken of me to his daughter in very severe terms.""As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally.

Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "It does; but it has to be heaped up very high to cover a wife'sdefects, if they be as radical as those in Caroline Everett. Why, tospeak out the plain, homespun truth, the girl's a fool!""She isn't over bright, Fred, I know," replied Lawson. "But to callher a fool, is to use rather a broad assertion.""She certainly hasn't good common sense. I would be ashamed of herin company a dozen times a day if she were any thing to me.""She's young, you know, Fred.""Yes, a young and silly girl.""Just silly enough for my purpose. But, she will grow older andwiser, you know. Young and silly is a very good fault.""Where is she now?""At a boarding school some thirty miles from New Haven. Do you knowwhy her father sent her there?""No.""She would meet me on her way to and from school while in the city,and the old gentleman had, I presume, some objections to me as ason-in-law.""And not without reason," replied Williams."I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with mywishes," continued Lawson. "Caroline told me where she was going,and I was not long in making a visit to the neighborhood. Greatattention is paid to physical development in the school, and theyoung ladies are required to walk, daily, in the open air, amid thebeautiful, romantic, and secluded scenery by which the place issurrounded. They walk alone, or in company, as suits their fancies.Caroline chose to walk alone when I was near at hand; and we met ina certain retired glen, where the sweet quiet of nature was brokenonly by the dreamy murmur of a silvery stream, and there we talkedof love. It is not in the heart of a woman to withstand a scene likethis. I told, in burning words, my passion, and she hearkened andwas won." Lawson paused for some moments; but, as Williams made noremark, he continued--"It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to amarriage. He is pence-proud, and I, as you know, am penniless.""I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law,"said Williams."I have the best of reasons, for knowing that he would not. He hasalready spoken of me to his daughter in very severe terms.""As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met.

"Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain.

They walk alone, or in company, as suits their fancies.Caroline chose to walk alone when I was near at hand; and we met ina certain retired glen, where the sweet quiet of nature was brokenonly by the dreamy murmur of a silvery stream, and there we talkedof love. It is not in the heart of a woman to withstand a scene likethis. I told, in burning words, my passion, and she hearkened andwas won." Lawson paused for some moments; but, as Williams made noremark, he continued--"It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to amarriage. He is pence-proud, and I, as you know, am penniless.""I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law,"said Williams."I have the best of reasons, for knowing that he would not. He hasalready spoken of me to his daughter in very severe terms.""As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S.

I would be ashamed of herin company a dozen times a day if she were any thing to me.""She's young, you know, Fred.""Yes, a young and silly girl.""Just silly enough for my purpose. But, she will grow older andwiser, you know. Young and silly is a very good fault.""Where is she now?""At a boarding school some thirty miles from New Haven. Do you knowwhy her father sent her there?""No.""She would meet me on her way to and from school while in the city,and the old gentleman had, I presume, some objections to me as ason-in-law.""And not without reason," replied Williams."I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with mywishes," continued Lawson. "Caroline told me where she was going,and I was not long in making a visit to the neighborhood. Greatattention is paid to physical development in the school, and theyoung ladies are required to walk, daily, in the open air, amid thebeautiful, romantic, and secluded scenery by which the place issurrounded.

Lawson paused for some moments; but, as Williams made noremark, he continued--"It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to amarriage.

For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "She's young, you know, Fred.""Yes, a young and silly girl.""Just silly enough for my purpose. But, she will grow older andwiser, you know. Young and silly is a very good fault.""Where is she now?""At a boarding school some thirty miles from New Haven. Do you knowwhy her father sent her there?""No.""She would meet me on her way to and from school while in the city,and the old gentleman had, I presume, some objections to me as ason-in-law.""And not without reason," replied Williams."I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with mywishes," continued Lawson. "Caroline told me where she was going,and I was not long in making a visit to the neighborhood. Greatattention is paid to physical development in the school, and theyoung ladies are required to walk, daily, in the open air, amid thebeautiful, romantic, and secluded scenery by which the place issurrounded. They walk alone, or in company, as suits their fancies.Caroline chose to walk alone when I was near at hand; and we met ina certain retired glen, where the sweet quiet of nature was brokenonly by the dreamy murmur of a silvery stream, and there we talkedof love. It is not in the heart of a woman to withstand a scene likethis. I told, in burning words, my passion, and she hearkened andwas won." Lawson paused for some moments; but, as Williams made noremark, he continued--"It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to amarriage. He is pence-proud, and I, as you know, am penniless.""I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law,"said Williams."I have the best of reasons, for knowing that he would not. He hasalready spoken of me to his daughter in very severe terms.""As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way.

Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "Just silly enough for my purpose. But, she will grow older andwiser, you know. Young and silly is a very good fault.""Where is she now?""At a boarding school some thirty miles from New Haven. Do you knowwhy her father sent her there?""No.""She would meet me on her way to and from school while in the city,and the old gentleman had, I presume, some objections to me as ason-in-law.""And not without reason," replied Williams."I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with mywishes," continued Lawson. "Caroline told me where she was going,and I was not long in making a visit to the neighborhood. Greatattention is paid to physical development in the school, and theyoung ladies are required to walk, daily, in the open air, amid thebeautiful, romantic, and secluded scenery by which the place issurrounded. They walk alone, or in company, as suits their fancies.Caroline chose to walk alone when I was near at hand; and we met ina certain retired glen, where the sweet quiet of nature was brokenonly by the dreamy murmur of a silvery stream, and there we talkedof love. It is not in the heart of a woman to withstand a scene likethis. I told, in burning words, my passion, and she hearkened andwas won." Lawson paused for some moments; but, as Williams made noremark, he continued--"It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to amarriage. He is pence-proud, and I, as you know, am penniless.""I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law,"said Williams."I have the best of reasons, for knowing that he would not. He hasalready spoken of me to his daughter in very severe terms.""As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible.

"It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father.

His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "At a boarding school some thirty miles from New Haven. Do you knowwhy her father sent her there?""No.""She would meet me on her way to and from school while in the city,and the old gentleman had, I presume, some objections to me as ason-in-law.""And not without reason," replied Williams."I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with mywishes," continued Lawson. "Caroline told me where she was going,and I was not long in making a visit to the neighborhood. Greatattention is paid to physical development in the school, and theyoung ladies are required to walk, daily, in the open air, amid thebeautiful, romantic, and secluded scenery by which the place issurrounded. They walk alone, or in company, as suits their fancies.Caroline chose to walk alone when I was near at hand; and we met ina certain retired glen, where the sweet quiet of nature was brokenonly by the dreamy murmur of a silvery stream, and there we talkedof love. It is not in the heart of a woman to withstand a scene likethis. I told, in burning words, my passion, and she hearkened andwas won." Lawson paused for some moments; but, as Williams made noremark, he continued--"It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to amarriage. He is pence-proud, and I, as you know, am penniless.""I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law,"said Williams."I have the best of reasons, for knowing that he would not. He hasalready spoken of me to his daughter in very severe terms.""As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime.

Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight.

But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "She would meet me on her way to and from school while in the city,and the old gentleman had, I presume, some objections to me as ason-in-law.""And not without reason," replied Williams."I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with mywishes," continued Lawson. "Caroline told me where she was going,and I was not long in making a visit to the neighborhood. Greatattention is paid to physical development in the school, and theyoung ladies are required to walk, daily, in the open air, amid thebeautiful, romantic, and secluded scenery by which the place issurrounded. They walk alone, or in company, as suits their fancies.Caroline chose to walk alone when I was near at hand; and we met ina certain retired glen, where the sweet quiet of nature was brokenonly by the dreamy murmur of a silvery stream, and there we talkedof love. It is not in the heart of a woman to withstand a scene likethis. I told, in burning words, my passion, and she hearkened andwas won." Lawson paused for some moments; but, as Williams made noremark, he continued--"It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to amarriage. He is pence-proud, and I, as you know, am penniless.""I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law,"said Williams."I have the best of reasons, for knowing that he would not. He hasalready spoken of me to his daughter in very severe terms.""As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished.

She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation.

Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with mywishes," continued Lawson. "Caroline told me where she was going,and I was not long in making a visit to the neighborhood. Greatattention is paid to physical development in the school, and theyoung ladies are required to walk, daily, in the open air, amid thebeautiful, romantic, and secluded scenery by which the place issurrounded. They walk alone, or in company, as suits their fancies.Caroline chose to walk alone when I was near at hand; and we met ina certain retired glen, where the sweet quiet of nature was brokenonly by the dreamy murmur of a silvery stream, and there we talkedof love. It is not in the heart of a woman to withstand a scene likethis. I told, in burning words, my passion, and she hearkened andwas won." Lawson paused for some moments; but, as Williams made noremark, he continued--"It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to amarriage. He is pence-proud, and I, as you know, am penniless.""I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law,"said Williams."I have the best of reasons, for knowing that he would not. He hasalready spoken of me to his daughter in very severe terms.""As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain.

Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S.

Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law,"said Williams."I have the best of reasons, for knowing that he would not. He hasalready spoken of me to his daughter in very severe terms.""As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether.

Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "As she has informed you?""Yes. But, like a sensible girl, she prefers consulting her owntaste in matters of the heart.""A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city.

And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "A very sensible girl, certainly!""Isn't she! Well, as delays are dangerous, I have made up my mind toconsummate this business as quickly as possible. You know how hardpressed I am in certain quarters, and how necessary it is that Ishould get my pecuniary matters in a more stable position. In aword, then, my business, on the present occasion, is to removeCaroline from school, it being my opinion that she has completed hereducation.""Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met.

"Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "Has she consented to this?""No; but she won't require any great persuasion. I'll manage allthat. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms atHoward's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow,with a carriage.""Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation.

He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "Where will you have the ceremony performed?""In this city. I have already engaged the Rev. Mr. B---- to do thatlittle work for me. He will join us at the hotel immediately on ourarrival, and in your presence, as a witness, the knot will be tied.""All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf.

From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "All very nicely arranged," said Williams."Isn't it! And what is more, the whole thing will go off like clockwork. Of course I can depend on you. You will meet us at the boat.""I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally.

The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "I will, certainly.""Then good by." They were by this time at the landing. The two youngmen shook hands, and Lawson sprung on board of the boat, whileWilliams returned thoughtfully to his office.Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family.

What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way.

Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle norcharacter. A connection with certain families in New York, added toa good address, polished manners, and an unblushing assurance, hadgiven him access to society at certain points, and of this facilityhe had taken every advantage. Too idle and dissolute for usefuleffort in society, he looked with a cold, calculating baseness tomarriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at whichhe aspired. Possessing no attractive virtues--no personal merits ofany kind, his prospects of a connection, such as he wished to form,through the medium of any honorable advances, were hopeless, andthis he perfectly well understood. But, the conviction did not inthe least abate the ardor of his purpose. And, in a mean anddastardly spirit, he approached one young school girl after another,until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flatteredby his attentions. The father of Caroline, who was a man of somediscrimination and force of mind, understood his daughter'scharacter, and knowing the danger to which she was exposed, keptupon her a watchful eye. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were notcontinued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at onceremoved her to a school at a distance from the city. It would havebeen wiser had he taken her home altogether. Lawson could havedesired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned.On the day succeeding that on which Lawson left New York, Carolinewas taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when shenoticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that herlover was in the neighborhood and awaiting her in the secluded glen,half a mile distant, where they had already met. Feigning to haveforgotten something, she ran back, but as soon as she was out ofsight of her companions, she glided off with rapid steps in thedirection where she expected to find Lawson. And she was notdisappointed."Dear Caroline!" he exclaimed, with affected tenderness, drawing hisarm about her and kissing her cheek, as he met her. "How happy I amto see you again! Oh! it has seemed months since I looked upon yoursweet young face.""And yet it is only a week since you were here," returned Caroline,looking at him fondly."I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now!

And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S.

It makes me wretched," said Lawson."And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain.

At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape!

Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "And I am miserable," responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyesfell to the ground. "Miserable," she repeated."I love you, tenderly, devotedly," said Lawson, as he tightlyclasped the hand he had taken: "and it is my most ardent wish tomake you happy. Oh! why should a parent's mistaken will interposebetween us and our dearest wishes?"Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply."Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible.

From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consentto--to--our--union?""None, I fear," came from the lips of Caroline in a faint whisper."Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally.

Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "Is he so strongly prejudiced against me?""Yes.""Then, what are we to do?"Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape!

Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way.

Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office Caroline sighed."To meet, hopelessly, is only to make us the more wretched," saidLawson. "Better part, and forever, than suffer a martyrdom ofaffection like this."Still closer shrunk the weak and foolish girl to the young man'sside. She was like a bird in the magic circle of the charmer."Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance.

His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office "Caroline," said Lawson, after another period of silence, and hisvoice was low, tender and penetrating--"Are you willing, for mysake, to brave your father's anger?""For your sake, Charles!" replied Caroline, with sudden enthusiasm."Yes--yes. His anger would be light to the loss of your affection.""Bless your true heart!" exclaimed Lawson. "I knew that I had nottrusted it in vain. And now, my dear girl, let me speak freely ofthe nature of my present visit. With you, I believe, that all hopeof your father's consent is vain. But, he is a man of tenderfeelings, and loves you as the apple of his eye."Thus urged the tempter, and Caroline listened eagerly."If," he continued, "we precipitate a union--if we put the marriagerite between us and his strong opposition, that opposition will growweak as a withering leaf. He cannot turn from you. He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness.

His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S.

He loves you toowell."Caroline did not answer; but, it needed no words to tell Lawson thathe was not urging his wishes in vain."I am here," at length he said, boldly, "for the purpose of takingyou to New York. Will you go with me?""For what end?" she whispered."To become my wife."There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished.

In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him. On returning to his office, he found hissister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocentyoung countenance, the idea of her being made the victim of so basea marriage, flashed with a pang amid his thoughts."I will have no part nor lot in this matter," he said, mentally. Andhe was in earnest in this resolution. But not long did his mind resteasy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated socialwrong, that one word from him might prevent. From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S.

From the thought ofbetraying Lawson's confidence, his mind shrunk with a certaininstinct of honor; while, at the same time, pressed upon him theirresistible conviction that a deeper dishonor would attach to himif he permitted the marriage to take place.The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately. The cloud would quickly melt intears, and then the sky would be purer and brighter than before.When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office There was no starting, shrinking, nor trembling at this proposal.Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistakenlove, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to beled to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim byher own consent.Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, whohad fallen into rather wild company, and strayed to some distancealong the paths of dissipation. But, he had a young andlovely-minded sister, who possessed much influence over him. Thevery sphere of her purity kept him from debasing himself to anygreat extent, and ever drew him back from a total abandonment ofhimself in the hour of temptation. He had been thrown a good dealinto the society of Lawson, who had many attractive points for youngmen about him, and who knew how to adapt himself to the charactersof those with whom he associated. In some things he did not likeLawson, who, at times, manifested such an entire want of principle,that he felt shocked. On parting with Lawson at the boat, as we haveseen, he walked thoughtfully away. His mind was far from approvingwhat he had heard, and the more he reflected upon it, the lesssatisfied did he feel. He knew enough of the character of Lawson tobe well satisfied that his marriage with Caroline, who was anovergrown, weak-minded school girl, would prove the wreck of herfuture happiness, and the thought of becoming a party to such atransaction troubled him.

His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline! What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way. Not once in a hundred instances, is aschool girl approached with lover-like attentions, except by a manwho is void of principle; and not once in a hundred instances domarriages entered upon clandestinely by such persons, prove otherthan an introduction to years of wretchedness.9 Add  The School Girl to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thoughtabout the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he methis sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeplyconscious of the responsibility resting upon him. His oft repeatedmental excuse--"It's none of my business," or, "I can't meddle inother men's affairs," did not satisfy certain convictions of rightand duty that presented themselves with, to him, a strangedistinctness. The thought of his own sister was instantly associatedwith the scheme of some false-hearted wretch, involving herhappiness in the way that the happiness of Caroline Everett was tobe involved; and he felt that the man who knew that another wasplotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, waslittle less than a villain at heart.On the next day Williams learned that there was a writ out againstthe person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling, he havingobtained a sum of money from a broker under circumstances construedby the laws into crime. This fact determined him to go at once toMr. Everett, who, as it might be supposed, was deeply agitated atthe painful intelligence he received. His first thought was toproceed immediately to New Haven, and there rescue his daughter fromthe hands of the young man; but on learning the arrangements thathad been made, he, after much reflecting, concluded that it would bebest to remain in New York, and meet them on their arrival.In the mean time, the foolish girl, whom Lawson had determined tosacrifice to his base cupidity, was half wild with delightedanticipation. Poor child! Passion-wrought romances, written by menand women who had neither right views of life, nor a purpose inliterature beyond gain or reputation, had bewildered her half-formedreason, and filled her imagination with. unreal pictures. All herideas were false or exaggerated. She was a woman, with the mind ofan inexperienced child; if to say this does not savor ofcontradiction. Without dreaming that there might be thorns to pierceher naked feet in the way she was about to enter, she moved forwardwith a joyful confidence.On the day she had agreed to return with Lawson, she met him earlyin the afternoon, and started for New Haven, where they spent thenight. On the following day they left in the steamboat for New York.All his arrangements for the marriage, were fully explained toCaroline by Lawson, and most of the time that elapsed after leavingNew Haven, was spent in settling their future action in regard tothe family. Caroline was confident that all would be forgiven afterthe first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that theywould be taken home immediately.

What has come over you!" said Lawson, in deep perplexity."This is only a weakness. Come! Nerve your heart like a brave, goodgirl! Come! It will soon be over."And he bent down and kissed her wet cheek, while she shrunk from himwith an involuntary dread. But, he drew his arm around her waist,and almost forced her to rise."There now! Dry your tears!" And he placed his handkerchief to hereyes. "It is but a moment of weakness, Caroline,--of naturalweakness."As he said this, he was pressing her forward towards the door of theapartment where the clergyman (such clergymen disgrace theirprofession) awaited their appearance."Charles?" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--"doyou love me?""Better than my own life!" was instantly replied."Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--tooinexperienced for this.""The moment we are united you shall go home," returned Lawson. "Iwill not hold you back an instant.""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go now!""Are you mad, girl!" exclaimed the young man, losing hisself-control. And, with a strong arm, he forced her into the nextroom. For a brief period, the clergyman hesitated, on seeing thedistressed bride. Then he opened the book he held in his hand andbegan to read the service. As his voice, in tones of solemnity,filled the apartment, Caroline grew calmer. She felt like one drivenforward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. All theresponses had been made by Lawson, and now the clergyman addressedher. Passively she was about uttering her assentation, when the doorof the room was thrown open, and two men entered."Stop!" was instantly cried in a loud, agitated voice, whichCaroline knew to be that of her father, and never did that voicecome to her ears with a more welcome sound.Lawson started, and moved from her side. While Caroline yet stoodtrembling and doubting, the man who had come in with Mr. Everettapproached Lawson, and laying his hand upon him, said--"I arrest youon a charge of swindling!"With a low cry of distress, Caroline sprung towards her father; buthe held his hands out towards her as if to keep her off, saying, atthe same time--"Are you his wife?""No, thank Heaven!" fell from her lips.In the next moment she was in her father's arms, and both wereweeping.Narrow indeed was the escape made by Caroline Everett; an escapewhich she did not fully comprehend until a few months afterwards,when the trial of Lawson took place, during which revelations ofvillany were made, the recital of which caused her heart to shudder.Yes, narrow had been her escape! Had her father been delayed a fewmoments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon aftercondemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell!May a vivid realization of what Caroline Everett escaped, warn otheryoung girls, who bear a similar relation to society, of the dangerthat lurks in their way.

Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Thankless Office When the boat touched the wharf, Lawson looked eagerly for theappearance of his friend Williams, and was disappointed, and nolittle troubled, at not seeing him. After most of the passengers hadgone on shore, he called a carriage, and was driven to Howard's,where he ordered a couple of rooms, after first enquiring whether afriend had not already performed this service for him. His next stepwas to write a note to the Rev. Mr. B----, desiring his immediateattendance, and, also, one to Williams, informing him of hisarrival. Anxiously, and with a nervous fear lest some untowardcircumstance might prevent the marriage he was about effecting witha silly heiress, did the young man await the response to thesenotes, and great was his relief, when informed, after the lapse ofan hour, that the Reverend gentleman, whose attendance he haddesired, was in the house.A private parlor had been engaged, and in this the ceremony ofmarriage was to take place. This parlor adjoined a chamber, in whichCaroline awaited, with a trembling heart, the issue of events. Itwas now, for the first time, as she was about taking the final andirretrievable step, that her resolution began to fail her. Herfather's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state uponwhich she was about entering, all came pressing upon her thoughtswith a sense of realization such as she had not known before.Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fastupon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she couldlook upon it stripped of its halo of romance. During the two daysthat she had been with Lawson, she had seen him in states of absentthought, when the true quality of his mind wrote itself out upon hisface so distinctly that even a dim-sighted one could read; and morethan once she had felt an inward shrinking from him that wasirrepressible. Weak and foolish as she was, she was yet pure-minded;and though in the beginning she did not, because her heart wasoverlaid with frivolity, perceive the sphere of his impurity, yetnow, as the moment was near at hand when there was to be amarriage-conjunction, she began to feel this sphere as somethingthat suffocated her spirit. At length, in the agitation ofcontending thoughts and emotions, the heart of the poor girl failedher, till, in the utter abandonment of feeling, she gave way to aflood of tears and commenced wringing her hands. At this moment,having arranged with the clergyman to begin the ceremony forthwith,Lawson entered her room, and, to his surprise, saw her in tears."Oh, Charles!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and extending themtowards him, "Take me home to my father! Oh, take me home to myfather!"Lawson was confounded at such an unexpected change in Caroline. "Youshall go to your father the moment the ceremony is over," hereplied; "Come! Mr. B---- is all ready.""Oh, no, no! Take me now! Take me now!" returned the poor girl in animploring voice. And she sat before the man who had tempted her fromthe path of safety, weeping, and quivering like a leaf in the wind."Caroline!
