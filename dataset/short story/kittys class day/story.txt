"A stitch in time saves nine.""O Pris, Pris, I'm really going! Here's the invitation--roughpaper--Chapel--spreads--Lyceum Hall--everything splendid; and Jack totake care of me!"As Kitty burst into the room and performed a rapturous pas seul,waving the cards over her head, sister Priscilla looked up from herwork with a smile of satisfaction on her quiet face."Who invites you, dear?""Why, Jack, of course,--dear old cousin Jack. Nobody else ever thinksof me, or cares whether I have a bit of pleasure now and then. Isn'the kind? Mayn't I go? and, O Pris, what shall I wear?"Kitty paused suddenly, as if the last all-important question had asolemnizing effect upon both mind and body."Why, your white muslin, silk sacque, and new hat, of course," beganPris with an air of surprise. But Kitty broke in impetuously,--"I'll never wear that old muslin again; it's full of darns, up to myknees, and all out of fashion. So is my sacque; and as for my hat,though it does well enough here, it would be absurd for Class Day.""You don't expect an entirely new suit for this occasion,--do you?"asked Pris, anxiously."Yes, I do, and I'll tell you how I mean to get it. I've plannedeverything; for, though I hardly dreamed of going, I amused myself bythinking how I could manage if I did get invited.""Let us hear." And Pris took up her work with an air of resignation."First, my dress," began Kitty, perching herself on the arm of thesofa, and entering into the subject with enthusiasm. "I've got the tendollars grandpa sent me, and with eight of it I'm going to buyLizzie King's organdie muslin. She got it in Paris; but her auntprovidentially--no, unfortunately--died; so she can't wear it, andwants to get rid of it. She is bigger than I am, you know; so there isenough for a little mantle or sacque, for it isn't made up. The skirtis cut off and gored, with a splendid train--""My dear, you don't mean you are going to wear one of those absurd,new-fashioned dresses?" exclaimed Pris, lifting hands and eyes."I do! Nothing would induce me to go to Class Day without a train.It's been the desire of my heart to have one, and now I will, ifI never have another gown to my back!" returned Kitty, with immensedecision.Pris shook her head, and said, "Go on!" as if prepared for anyextravagance after that."We can make it ourselves," continued Kitty, "and trim it with thesame. It's white with blue stripes and daisies in the stripes; theloveliest thing you ever saw, and can't be got here. So simple,yet distingue, I know you'll like it. Next, my bonnet,"--here thesolemnity of Kitty's face and manner was charming to behold. "I shallmake it out of one of my new illusion undersleeves. I've never wornthem; and the puffed part will be a plenty for a little fly-awaybonnet of the latest style. I've got blue ribbons to tie it with, andhave only to look up some daisies for the inside. With my extra twodollars I shall buy my gloves, and pay my fares,--and there I am, allcomplete."She looked so happy, so pretty, and full of girlish satisfaction, thatsister Pris couldn't bear to disturb the little plan, much as shedisapproved of it. They were poor, and every penny had to be counted.There were plenty of neighbors to gossip and criticise, and plenty offriends to make disagreeable remarks on any unusual extravagance.Pris saw things with the prudent eyes of thirty, but Kitty with theromantic eyes of seventeen; and the elder sister, in the kindness ofher heart, had no wish to sadden life to those bright young eyes,or deny the child a harmless pleasure. She sewed thoughtfully for aminute, then looked up, saying, with the smile that always assuredKitty the day was won,--"Get your things together, and we will see what can be done. Butremember, dear, that it is both bad taste and bad economy for poorpeople to try to ape the rich.""You're a perfect angel, Pris; so don't moralize. I'll run and get thedress, and we'll begin at once, for there is much to do, and onlytwo days to do it in." And Kitty skipped away, singing "LaurigerHoratius," at the top of her voice.Priscilla soon found that the girl's head was completely turned by theadvice and example of certain fashionable young neighbors. It was invain for Pris to remonstrate and warn."Just this once let me do as others do, and thoroughly enjoy myself."pleaded Kitty; and Pris yielded, saying to herself, "She shall haveher wish, and if she learns a lesson, neither time nor money will belost."So they snipped and sewed, and planned and pieced, going through allthe alternations of despair and triumph, worry and satisfaction, whichwomen undergo when a new suit is under way. Company kept coming, fornews of Kitty's expedition had flown abroad, and her young friendsmust just run in to hear about it, and ask what she was going to wear;while Kitty was so glad and proud to tell, and show, and enjoy herlittle triumph that many half hours were wasted, and the second dayfound much still to do.The lovely muslin didn't hold out, and Kitty sacrificed the waist tothe train, for a train she must have or the whole thing would be anutter failure. A little sacque was eked out, however, and when thefrills were on, it was "ravishing," as Kitty said, with a sigh ofmingled delight and fatigue. The gored skirt was a fearful job, as anyone who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify; and beforethe facing, even experienced Pris quailed.The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, it wasdiscovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was acatastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, thestores of her friends, and rummaged in vain. There was no time to sendto the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescuedher by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy toher because her life was spent for others. Some one suggested a stripof blue illusion,--and that could be got; but, alas! Kitty hadno money, for the gloves were already bought. Pris heard thelamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled hersister out of a slough of despond with two yards of "heavenly tulle.""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "A stitch in time saves nine.""O Pris, Pris, I'm really going! Here's the invitation--roughpaper--Chapel--spreads--Lyceum Hall--everything splendid; and Jack totake care of me!"As Kitty burst into the room and performed a rapturous pas seul,waving the cards over her head, sister Priscilla looked up from herwork with a smile of satisfaction on her quiet face."Who invites you, dear?""Why, Jack, of course,--dear old cousin Jack. Nobody else ever thinksof me, or cares whether I have a bit of pleasure now and then. Isn'the kind? Mayn't I go? and, O Pris, what shall I wear?"Kitty paused suddenly, as if the last all-important question had asolemnizing effect upon both mind and body."Why, your white muslin, silk sacque, and new hat, of course," beganPris with an air of surprise. But Kitty broke in impetuously,--"I'll never wear that old muslin again; it's full of darns, up to myknees, and all out of fashion. So is my sacque; and as for my hat,though it does well enough here, it would be absurd for Class Day.""You don't expect an entirely new suit for this occasion,--do you?"asked Pris, anxiously."Yes, I do, and I'll tell you how I mean to get it. I've plannedeverything; for, though I hardly dreamed of going, I amused myself bythinking how I could manage if I did get invited.""Let us hear." And Pris took up her work with an air of resignation."First, my dress," began Kitty, perching herself on the arm of thesofa, and entering into the subject with enthusiasm. "I've got the tendollars grandpa sent me, and with eight of it I'm going to buyLizzie King's organdie muslin. She got it in Paris; but her auntprovidentially--no, unfortunately--died; so she can't wear it, andwants to get rid of it. She is bigger than I am, you know; so there isenough for a little mantle or sacque, for it isn't made up. The skirtis cut off and gored, with a splendid train--""My dear, you don't mean you are going to wear one of those absurd,new-fashioned dresses?" exclaimed Pris, lifting hands and eyes."I do! Nothing would induce me to go to Class Day without a train.It's been the desire of my heart to have one, and now I will, ifI never have another gown to my back!" returned Kitty, with immensedecision.Pris shook her head, and said, "Go on!" as if prepared for anyextravagance after that."We can make it ourselves," continued Kitty, "and trim it with thesame. It's white with blue stripes and daisies in the stripes; theloveliest thing you ever saw, and can't be got here. So simple,yet distingue, I know you'll like it. Next, my bonnet,"--here thesolemnity of Kitty's face and manner was charming to behold. "I shallmake it out of one of my new illusion undersleeves. I've never wornthem; and the puffed part will be a plenty for a little fly-awaybonnet of the latest style. I've got blue ribbons to tie it with, andhave only to look up some daisies for the inside. With my extra twodollars I shall buy my gloves, and pay my fares,--and there I am, allcomplete."She looked so happy, so pretty, and full of girlish satisfaction, thatsister Pris couldn't bear to disturb the little plan, much as shedisapproved of it. They were poor, and every penny had to be counted.There were plenty of neighbors to gossip and criticise, and plenty offriends to make disagreeable remarks on any unusual extravagance.Pris saw things with the prudent eyes of thirty, but Kitty with theromantic eyes of seventeen; and the elder sister, in the kindness ofher heart, had no wish to sadden life to those bright young eyes,or deny the child a harmless pleasure. She sewed thoughtfully for aminute, then looked up, saying, with the smile that always assuredKitty the day was won,--"Get your things together, and we will see what can be done. Butremember, dear, that it is both bad taste and bad economy for poorpeople to try to ape the rich.""You're a perfect angel, Pris; so don't moralize. I'll run and get thedress, and we'll begin at once, for there is much to do, and onlytwo days to do it in." And Kitty skipped away, singing "LaurigerHoratius," at the top of her voice.Priscilla soon found that the girl's head was completely turned by theadvice and example of certain fashionable young neighbors. It was invain for Pris to remonstrate and warn."Just this once let me do as others do, and thoroughly enjoy myself."pleaded Kitty; and Pris yielded, saying to herself, "She shall haveher wish, and if she learns a lesson, neither time nor money will belost."So they snipped and sewed, and planned and pieced, going through allthe alternations of despair and triumph, worry and satisfaction, whichwomen undergo when a new suit is under way. Company kept coming, fornews of Kitty's expedition had flown abroad, and her young friendsmust just run in to hear about it, and ask what she was going to wear;while Kitty was so glad and proud to tell, and show, and enjoy herlittle triumph that many half hours were wasted, and the second dayfound much still to do.The lovely muslin didn't hold out, and Kitty sacrificed the waist tothe train, for a train she must have or the whole thing would be anutter failure. A little sacque was eked out, however, and when thefrills were on, it was "ravishing," as Kitty said, with a sigh ofmingled delight and fatigue. The gored skirt was a fearful job, as anyone who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify; and beforethe facing, even experienced Pris quailed.The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, it wasdiscovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was acatastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, thestores of her friends, and rummaged in vain. There was no time to sendto the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescuedher by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy toher because her life was spent for others. Some one suggested a stripof blue illusion,--and that could be got; but, alas! Kitty hadno money, for the gloves were already bought. Pris heard thelamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled hersister out of a slough of despond with two yards of "heavenly tulle.""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "O Pris, Pris, I'm really going! Here's the invitation--roughpaper--Chapel--spreads--Lyceum Hall--everything splendid; and Jack totake care of me!"As Kitty burst into the room and performed a rapturous pas seul,waving the cards over her head, sister Priscilla looked up from herwork with a smile of satisfaction on her quiet face."Who invites you, dear?""Why, Jack, of course,--dear old cousin Jack. Nobody else ever thinksof me, or cares whether I have a bit of pleasure now and then. Isn'the kind? Mayn't I go? and, O Pris, what shall I wear?"Kitty paused suddenly, as if the last all-important question had asolemnizing effect upon both mind and body."Why, your white muslin, silk sacque, and new hat, of course," beganPris with an air of surprise. But Kitty broke in impetuously,--"I'll never wear that old muslin again; it's full of darns, up to myknees, and all out of fashion. So is my sacque; and as for my hat,though it does well enough here, it would be absurd for Class Day.""You don't expect an entirely new suit for this occasion,--do you?"asked Pris, anxiously."Yes, I do, and I'll tell you how I mean to get it. I've plannedeverything; for, though I hardly dreamed of going, I amused myself bythinking how I could manage if I did get invited.""Let us hear." And Pris took up her work with an air of resignation."First, my dress," began Kitty, perching herself on the arm of thesofa, and entering into the subject with enthusiasm. "I've got the tendollars grandpa sent me, and with eight of it I'm going to buyLizzie King's organdie muslin. She got it in Paris; but her auntprovidentially--no, unfortunately--died; so she can't wear it, andwants to get rid of it. She is bigger than I am, you know; so there isenough for a little mantle or sacque, for it isn't made up. The skirtis cut off and gored, with a splendid train--""My dear, you don't mean you are going to wear one of those absurd,new-fashioned dresses?" exclaimed Pris, lifting hands and eyes."I do! Nothing would induce me to go to Class Day without a train.It's been the desire of my heart to have one, and now I will, ifI never have another gown to my back!" returned Kitty, with immensedecision.Pris shook her head, and said, "Go on!" as if prepared for anyextravagance after that."We can make it ourselves," continued Kitty, "and trim it with thesame. It's white with blue stripes and daisies in the stripes; theloveliest thing you ever saw, and can't be got here. So simple,yet distingue, I know you'll like it. Next, my bonnet,"--here thesolemnity of Kitty's face and manner was charming to behold. "I shallmake it out of one of my new illusion undersleeves. I've never wornthem; and the puffed part will be a plenty for a little fly-awaybonnet of the latest style. I've got blue ribbons to tie it with, andhave only to look up some daisies for the inside. With my extra twodollars I shall buy my gloves, and pay my fares,--and there I am, allcomplete."She looked so happy, so pretty, and full of girlish satisfaction, thatsister Pris couldn't bear to disturb the little plan, much as shedisapproved of it. They were poor, and every penny had to be counted.There were plenty of neighbors to gossip and criticise, and plenty offriends to make disagreeable remarks on any unusual extravagance.Pris saw things with the prudent eyes of thirty, but Kitty with theromantic eyes of seventeen; and the elder sister, in the kindness ofher heart, had no wish to sadden life to those bright young eyes,or deny the child a harmless pleasure. She sewed thoughtfully for aminute, then looked up, saying, with the smile that always assuredKitty the day was won,--"Get your things together, and we will see what can be done. Butremember, dear, that it is both bad taste and bad economy for poorpeople to try to ape the rich.""You're a perfect angel, Pris; so don't moralize. I'll run and get thedress, and we'll begin at once, for there is much to do, and onlytwo days to do it in." And Kitty skipped away, singing "LaurigerHoratius," at the top of her voice.Priscilla soon found that the girl's head was completely turned by theadvice and example of certain fashionable young neighbors. It was invain for Pris to remonstrate and warn."Just this once let me do as others do, and thoroughly enjoy myself."pleaded Kitty; and Pris yielded, saying to herself, "She shall haveher wish, and if she learns a lesson, neither time nor money will belost."So they snipped and sewed, and planned and pieced, going through allthe alternations of despair and triumph, worry and satisfaction, whichwomen undergo when a new suit is under way. Company kept coming, fornews of Kitty's expedition had flown abroad, and her young friendsmust just run in to hear about it, and ask what she was going to wear;while Kitty was so glad and proud to tell, and show, and enjoy herlittle triumph that many half hours were wasted, and the second dayfound much still to do.The lovely muslin didn't hold out, and Kitty sacrificed the waist tothe train, for a train she must have or the whole thing would be anutter failure. A little sacque was eked out, however, and when thefrills were on, it was "ravishing," as Kitty said, with a sigh ofmingled delight and fatigue. The gored skirt was a fearful job, as anyone who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify; and beforethe facing, even experienced Pris quailed.The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, it wasdiscovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was acatastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, thestores of her friends, and rummaged in vain. There was no time to sendto the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescuedher by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy toher because her life was spent for others. Some one suggested a stripof blue illusion,--and that could be got; but, alas! Kitty hadno money, for the gloves were already bought. Pris heard thelamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled hersister out of a slough of despond with two yards of "heavenly tulle.""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog As Kitty burst into the room and performed a rapturous pas seul,waving the cards over her head, sister Priscilla looked up from herwork with a smile of satisfaction on her quiet face."Who invites you, dear?""Why, Jack, of course,--dear old cousin Jack. Nobody else ever thinksof me, or cares whether I have a bit of pleasure now and then. Isn'the kind? Mayn't I go? and, O Pris, what shall I wear?"Kitty paused suddenly, as if the last all-important question had asolemnizing effect upon both mind and body."Why, your white muslin, silk sacque, and new hat, of course," beganPris with an air of surprise. But Kitty broke in impetuously,--"I'll never wear that old muslin again; it's full of darns, up to myknees, and all out of fashion. So is my sacque; and as for my hat,though it does well enough here, it would be absurd for Class Day.""You don't expect an entirely new suit for this occasion,--do you?"asked Pris, anxiously."Yes, I do, and I'll tell you how I mean to get it. I've plannedeverything; for, though I hardly dreamed of going, I amused myself bythinking how I could manage if I did get invited.""Let us hear." And Pris took up her work with an air of resignation."First, my dress," began Kitty, perching herself on the arm of thesofa, and entering into the subject with enthusiasm. "I've got the tendollars grandpa sent me, and with eight of it I'm going to buyLizzie King's organdie muslin. She got it in Paris; but her auntprovidentially--no, unfortunately--died; so she can't wear it, andwants to get rid of it. She is bigger than I am, you know; so there isenough for a little mantle or sacque, for it isn't made up. The skirtis cut off and gored, with a splendid train--""My dear, you don't mean you are going to wear one of those absurd,new-fashioned dresses?" exclaimed Pris, lifting hands and eyes."I do! Nothing would induce me to go to Class Day without a train.It's been the desire of my heart to have one, and now I will, ifI never have another gown to my back!" returned Kitty, with immensedecision.Pris shook her head, and said, "Go on!" as if prepared for anyextravagance after that."We can make it ourselves," continued Kitty, "and trim it with thesame. It's white with blue stripes and daisies in the stripes; theloveliest thing you ever saw, and can't be got here. So simple,yet distingue, I know you'll like it. Next, my bonnet,"--here thesolemnity of Kitty's face and manner was charming to behold. "I shallmake it out of one of my new illusion undersleeves. I've never wornthem; and the puffed part will be a plenty for a little fly-awaybonnet of the latest style. I've got blue ribbons to tie it with, andhave only to look up some daisies for the inside. With my extra twodollars I shall buy my gloves, and pay my fares,--and there I am, allcomplete."She looked so happy, so pretty, and full of girlish satisfaction, thatsister Pris couldn't bear to disturb the little plan, much as shedisapproved of it. They were poor, and every penny had to be counted.There were plenty of neighbors to gossip and criticise, and plenty offriends to make disagreeable remarks on any unusual extravagance.Pris saw things with the prudent eyes of thirty, but Kitty with theromantic eyes of seventeen; and the elder sister, in the kindness ofher heart, had no wish to sadden life to those bright young eyes,or deny the child a harmless pleasure. She sewed thoughtfully for aminute, then looked up, saying, with the smile that always assuredKitty the day was won,--"Get your things together, and we will see what can be done. Butremember, dear, that it is both bad taste and bad economy for poorpeople to try to ape the rich.""You're a perfect angel, Pris; so don't moralize. I'll run and get thedress, and we'll begin at once, for there is much to do, and onlytwo days to do it in." And Kitty skipped away, singing "LaurigerHoratius," at the top of her voice.Priscilla soon found that the girl's head was completely turned by theadvice and example of certain fashionable young neighbors. It was invain for Pris to remonstrate and warn."Just this once let me do as others do, and thoroughly enjoy myself."pleaded Kitty; and Pris yielded, saying to herself, "She shall haveher wish, and if she learns a lesson, neither time nor money will belost."So they snipped and sewed, and planned and pieced, going through allthe alternations of despair and triumph, worry and satisfaction, whichwomen undergo when a new suit is under way. Company kept coming, fornews of Kitty's expedition had flown abroad, and her young friendsmust just run in to hear about it, and ask what she was going to wear;while Kitty was so glad and proud to tell, and show, and enjoy herlittle triumph that many half hours were wasted, and the second dayfound much still to do.The lovely muslin didn't hold out, and Kitty sacrificed the waist tothe train, for a train she must have or the whole thing would be anutter failure. A little sacque was eked out, however, and when thefrills were on, it was "ravishing," as Kitty said, with a sigh ofmingled delight and fatigue. The gored skirt was a fearful job, as anyone who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify; and beforethe facing, even experienced Pris quailed.The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, it wasdiscovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was acatastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, thestores of her friends, and rummaged in vain. There was no time to sendto the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescuedher by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy toher because her life was spent for others. Some one suggested a stripof blue illusion,--and that could be got; but, alas! Kitty hadno money, for the gloves were already bought. Pris heard thelamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled hersister out of a slough of despond with two yards of "heavenly tulle.""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "Who invites you, dear?""Why, Jack, of course,--dear old cousin Jack. Nobody else ever thinksof me, or cares whether I have a bit of pleasure now and then. Isn'the kind? Mayn't I go? and, O Pris, what shall I wear?"Kitty paused suddenly, as if the last all-important question had asolemnizing effect upon both mind and body."Why, your white muslin, silk sacque, and new hat, of course," beganPris with an air of surprise. But Kitty broke in impetuously,--"I'll never wear that old muslin again; it's full of darns, up to myknees, and all out of fashion. So is my sacque; and as for my hat,though it does well enough here, it would be absurd for Class Day.""You don't expect an entirely new suit for this occasion,--do you?"asked Pris, anxiously."Yes, I do, and I'll tell you how I mean to get it. I've plannedeverything; for, though I hardly dreamed of going, I amused myself bythinking how I could manage if I did get invited.""Let us hear." And Pris took up her work with an air of resignation."First, my dress," began Kitty, perching herself on the arm of thesofa, and entering into the subject with enthusiasm. "I've got the tendollars grandpa sent me, and with eight of it I'm going to buyLizzie King's organdie muslin. She got it in Paris; but her auntprovidentially--no, unfortunately--died; so she can't wear it, andwants to get rid of it. She is bigger than I am, you know; so there isenough for a little mantle or sacque, for it isn't made up. The skirtis cut off and gored, with a splendid train--""My dear, you don't mean you are going to wear one of those absurd,new-fashioned dresses?" exclaimed Pris, lifting hands and eyes."I do! Nothing would induce me to go to Class Day without a train.It's been the desire of my heart to have one, and now I will, ifI never have another gown to my back!" returned Kitty, with immensedecision.Pris shook her head, and said, "Go on!" as if prepared for anyextravagance after that."We can make it ourselves," continued Kitty, "and trim it with thesame. It's white with blue stripes and daisies in the stripes; theloveliest thing you ever saw, and can't be got here. So simple,yet distingue, I know you'll like it. Next, my bonnet,"--here thesolemnity of Kitty's face and manner was charming to behold. "I shallmake it out of one of my new illusion undersleeves. I've never wornthem; and the puffed part will be a plenty for a little fly-awaybonnet of the latest style. I've got blue ribbons to tie it with, andhave only to look up some daisies for the inside. With my extra twodollars I shall buy my gloves, and pay my fares,--and there I am, allcomplete."She looked so happy, so pretty, and full of girlish satisfaction, thatsister Pris couldn't bear to disturb the little plan, much as shedisapproved of it. They were poor, and every penny had to be counted.There were plenty of neighbors to gossip and criticise, and plenty offriends to make disagreeable remarks on any unusual extravagance.Pris saw things with the prudent eyes of thirty, but Kitty with theromantic eyes of seventeen; and the elder sister, in the kindness ofher heart, had no wish to sadden life to those bright young eyes,or deny the child a harmless pleasure. She sewed thoughtfully for aminute, then looked up, saying, with the smile that always assuredKitty the day was won,--"Get your things together, and we will see what can be done. Butremember, dear, that it is both bad taste and bad economy for poorpeople to try to ape the rich.""You're a perfect angel, Pris; so don't moralize. I'll run and get thedress, and we'll begin at once, for there is much to do, and onlytwo days to do it in." And Kitty skipped away, singing "LaurigerHoratius," at the top of her voice.Priscilla soon found that the girl's head was completely turned by theadvice and example of certain fashionable young neighbors. It was invain for Pris to remonstrate and warn."Just this once let me do as others do, and thoroughly enjoy myself."pleaded Kitty; and Pris yielded, saying to herself, "She shall haveher wish, and if she learns a lesson, neither time nor money will belost."So they snipped and sewed, and planned and pieced, going through allthe alternations of despair and triumph, worry and satisfaction, whichwomen undergo when a new suit is under way. Company kept coming, fornews of Kitty's expedition had flown abroad, and her young friendsmust just run in to hear about it, and ask what she was going to wear;while Kitty was so glad and proud to tell, and show, and enjoy herlittle triumph that many half hours were wasted, and the second dayfound much still to do.The lovely muslin didn't hold out, and Kitty sacrificed the waist tothe train, for a train she must have or the whole thing would be anutter failure. A little sacque was eked out, however, and when thefrills were on, it was "ravishing," as Kitty said, with a sigh ofmingled delight and fatigue. The gored skirt was a fearful job, as anyone who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify; and beforethe facing, even experienced Pris quailed.The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, it wasdiscovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was acatastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, thestores of her friends, and rummaged in vain. There was no time to sendto the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescuedher by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy toher because her life was spent for others. Some one suggested a stripof blue illusion,--and that could be got; but, alas! Kitty hadno money, for the gloves were already bought. Pris heard thelamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled hersister out of a slough of despond with two yards of "heavenly tulle.""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "Why, Jack, of course,--dear old cousin Jack. Nobody else ever thinksof me, or cares whether I have a bit of pleasure now and then. Isn'the kind? Mayn't I go? and, O Pris, what shall I wear?"Kitty paused suddenly, as if the last all-important question had asolemnizing effect upon both mind and body."Why, your white muslin, silk sacque, and new hat, of course," beganPris with an air of surprise. But Kitty broke in impetuously,--"I'll never wear that old muslin again; it's full of darns, up to myknees, and all out of fashion. So is my sacque; and as for my hat,though it does well enough here, it would be absurd for Class Day.""You don't expect an entirely new suit for this occasion,--do you?"asked Pris, anxiously."Yes, I do, and I'll tell you how I mean to get it. I've plannedeverything; for, though I hardly dreamed of going, I amused myself bythinking how I could manage if I did get invited.""Let us hear." And Pris took up her work with an air of resignation."First, my dress," began Kitty, perching herself on the arm of thesofa, and entering into the subject with enthusiasm. "I've got the tendollars grandpa sent me, and with eight of it I'm going to buyLizzie King's organdie muslin. She got it in Paris; but her auntprovidentially--no, unfortunately--died; so she can't wear it, andwants to get rid of it. She is bigger than I am, you know; so there isenough for a little mantle or sacque, for it isn't made up. The skirtis cut off and gored, with a splendid train--""My dear, you don't mean you are going to wear one of those absurd,new-fashioned dresses?" exclaimed Pris, lifting hands and eyes."I do! Nothing would induce me to go to Class Day without a train.It's been the desire of my heart to have one, and now I will, ifI never have another gown to my back!" returned Kitty, with immensedecision.Pris shook her head, and said, "Go on!" as if prepared for anyextravagance after that."We can make it ourselves," continued Kitty, "and trim it with thesame. It's white with blue stripes and daisies in the stripes; theloveliest thing you ever saw, and can't be got here. So simple,yet distingue, I know you'll like it. Next, my bonnet,"--here thesolemnity of Kitty's face and manner was charming to behold. "I shallmake it out of one of my new illusion undersleeves. I've never wornthem; and the puffed part will be a plenty for a little fly-awaybonnet of the latest style. I've got blue ribbons to tie it with, andhave only to look up some daisies for the inside. With my extra twodollars I shall buy my gloves, and pay my fares,--and there I am, allcomplete."She looked so happy, so pretty, and full of girlish satisfaction, thatsister Pris couldn't bear to disturb the little plan, much as shedisapproved of it. They were poor, and every penny had to be counted.There were plenty of neighbors to gossip and criticise, and plenty offriends to make disagreeable remarks on any unusual extravagance.Pris saw things with the prudent eyes of thirty, but Kitty with theromantic eyes of seventeen; and the elder sister, in the kindness ofher heart, had no wish to sadden life to those bright young eyes,or deny the child a harmless pleasure. She sewed thoughtfully for aminute, then looked up, saying, with the smile that always assuredKitty the day was won,--"Get your things together, and we will see what can be done. Butremember, dear, that it is both bad taste and bad economy for poorpeople to try to ape the rich.""You're a perfect angel, Pris; so don't moralize. I'll run and get thedress, and we'll begin at once, for there is much to do, and onlytwo days to do it in." And Kitty skipped away, singing "LaurigerHoratius," at the top of her voice.Priscilla soon found that the girl's head was completely turned by theadvice and example of certain fashionable young neighbors. It was invain for Pris to remonstrate and warn."Just this once let me do as others do, and thoroughly enjoy myself."pleaded Kitty; and Pris yielded, saying to herself, "She shall haveher wish, and if she learns a lesson, neither time nor money will belost."So they snipped and sewed, and planned and pieced, going through allthe alternations of despair and triumph, worry and satisfaction, whichwomen undergo when a new suit is under way. Company kept coming, fornews of Kitty's expedition had flown abroad, and her young friendsmust just run in to hear about it, and ask what she was going to wear;while Kitty was so glad and proud to tell, and show, and enjoy herlittle triumph that many half hours were wasted, and the second dayfound much still to do.The lovely muslin didn't hold out, and Kitty sacrificed the waist tothe train, for a train she must have or the whole thing would be anutter failure. A little sacque was eked out, however, and when thefrills were on, it was "ravishing," as Kitty said, with a sigh ofmingled delight and fatigue. The gored skirt was a fearful job, as anyone who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify; and beforethe facing, even experienced Pris quailed.The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, it wasdiscovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was acatastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, thestores of her friends, and rummaged in vain. There was no time to sendto the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescuedher by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy toher because her life was spent for others. Some one suggested a stripof blue illusion,--and that could be got; but, alas! Kitty hadno money, for the gloves were already bought. Pris heard thelamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled hersister out of a slough of despond with two yards of "heavenly tulle.""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog Kitty paused suddenly, as if the last all-important question had asolemnizing effect upon both mind and body."Why, your white muslin, silk sacque, and new hat, of course," beganPris with an air of surprise. But Kitty broke in impetuously,--"I'll never wear that old muslin again; it's full of darns, up to myknees, and all out of fashion. So is my sacque; and as for my hat,though it does well enough here, it would be absurd for Class Day.""You don't expect an entirely new suit for this occasion,--do you?"asked Pris, anxiously."Yes, I do, and I'll tell you how I mean to get it. I've plannedeverything; for, though I hardly dreamed of going, I amused myself bythinking how I could manage if I did get invited.""Let us hear." And Pris took up her work with an air of resignation."First, my dress," began Kitty, perching herself on the arm of thesofa, and entering into the subject with enthusiasm. "I've got the tendollars grandpa sent me, and with eight of it I'm going to buyLizzie King's organdie muslin. She got it in Paris; but her auntprovidentially--no, unfortunately--died; so she can't wear it, andwants to get rid of it. She is bigger than I am, you know; so there isenough for a little mantle or sacque, for it isn't made up. The skirtis cut off and gored, with a splendid train--""My dear, you don't mean you are going to wear one of those absurd,new-fashioned dresses?" exclaimed Pris, lifting hands and eyes."I do! Nothing would induce me to go to Class Day without a train.It's been the desire of my heart to have one, and now I will, ifI never have another gown to my back!" returned Kitty, with immensedecision.Pris shook her head, and said, "Go on!" as if prepared for anyextravagance after that."We can make it ourselves," continued Kitty, "and trim it with thesame. It's white with blue stripes and daisies in the stripes; theloveliest thing you ever saw, and can't be got here. So simple,yet distingue, I know you'll like it. Next, my bonnet,"--here thesolemnity of Kitty's face and manner was charming to behold. "I shallmake it out of one of my new illusion undersleeves. I've never wornthem; and the puffed part will be a plenty for a little fly-awaybonnet of the latest style. I've got blue ribbons to tie it with, andhave only to look up some daisies for the inside. With my extra twodollars I shall buy my gloves, and pay my fares,--and there I am, allcomplete."She looked so happy, so pretty, and full of girlish satisfaction, thatsister Pris couldn't bear to disturb the little plan, much as shedisapproved of it. They were poor, and every penny had to be counted.There were plenty of neighbors to gossip and criticise, and plenty offriends to make disagreeable remarks on any unusual extravagance.Pris saw things with the prudent eyes of thirty, but Kitty with theromantic eyes of seventeen; and the elder sister, in the kindness ofher heart, had no wish to sadden life to those bright young eyes,or deny the child a harmless pleasure. She sewed thoughtfully for aminute, then looked up, saying, with the smile that always assuredKitty the day was won,--"Get your things together, and we will see what can be done. Butremember, dear, that it is both bad taste and bad economy for poorpeople to try to ape the rich.""You're a perfect angel, Pris; so don't moralize. I'll run and get thedress, and we'll begin at once, for there is much to do, and onlytwo days to do it in." And Kitty skipped away, singing "LaurigerHoratius," at the top of her voice.Priscilla soon found that the girl's head was completely turned by theadvice and example of certain fashionable young neighbors. It was invain for Pris to remonstrate and warn."Just this once let me do as others do, and thoroughly enjoy myself."pleaded Kitty; and Pris yielded, saying to herself, "She shall haveher wish, and if she learns a lesson, neither time nor money will belost."So they snipped and sewed, and planned and pieced, going through allthe alternations of despair and triumph, worry and satisfaction, whichwomen undergo when a new suit is under way. Company kept coming, fornews of Kitty's expedition had flown abroad, and her young friendsmust just run in to hear about it, and ask what she was going to wear;while Kitty was so glad and proud to tell, and show, and enjoy herlittle triumph that many half hours were wasted, and the second dayfound much still to do.The lovely muslin didn't hold out, and Kitty sacrificed the waist tothe train, for a train she must have or the whole thing would be anutter failure. A little sacque was eked out, however, and when thefrills were on, it was "ravishing," as Kitty said, with a sigh ofmingled delight and fatigue. The gored skirt was a fearful job, as anyone who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify; and beforethe facing, even experienced Pris quailed.The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, it wasdiscovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was acatastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, thestores of her friends, and rummaged in vain. There was no time to sendto the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescuedher by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy toher because her life was spent for others. Some one suggested a stripof blue illusion,--and that could be got; but, alas! Kitty hadno money, for the gloves were already bought. Pris heard thelamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled hersister out of a slough of despond with two yards of "heavenly tulle.""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "Why, your white muslin, silk sacque, and new hat, of course," beganPris with an air of surprise. But Kitty broke in impetuously,--"I'll never wear that old muslin again; it's full of darns, up to myknees, and all out of fashion. So is my sacque; and as for my hat,though it does well enough here, it would be absurd for Class Day.""You don't expect an entirely new suit for this occasion,--do you?"asked Pris, anxiously."Yes, I do, and I'll tell you how I mean to get it. I've plannedeverything; for, though I hardly dreamed of going, I amused myself bythinking how I could manage if I did get invited.""Let us hear." And Pris took up her work with an air of resignation."First, my dress," began Kitty, perching herself on the arm of thesofa, and entering into the subject with enthusiasm. "I've got the tendollars grandpa sent me, and with eight of it I'm going to buyLizzie King's organdie muslin. She got it in Paris; but her auntprovidentially--no, unfortunately--died; so she can't wear it, andwants to get rid of it. She is bigger than I am, you know; so there isenough for a little mantle or sacque, for it isn't made up. The skirtis cut off and gored, with a splendid train--""My dear, you don't mean you are going to wear one of those absurd,new-fashioned dresses?" exclaimed Pris, lifting hands and eyes."I do! Nothing would induce me to go to Class Day without a train.It's been the desire of my heart to have one, and now I will, ifI never have another gown to my back!" returned Kitty, with immensedecision.Pris shook her head, and said, "Go on!" as if prepared for anyextravagance after that."We can make it ourselves," continued Kitty, "and trim it with thesame. It's white with blue stripes and daisies in the stripes; theloveliest thing you ever saw, and can't be got here. So simple,yet distingue, I know you'll like it. Next, my bonnet,"--here thesolemnity of Kitty's face and manner was charming to behold. "I shallmake it out of one of my new illusion undersleeves. I've never wornthem; and the puffed part will be a plenty for a little fly-awaybonnet of the latest style. I've got blue ribbons to tie it with, andhave only to look up some daisies for the inside. With my extra twodollars I shall buy my gloves, and pay my fares,--and there I am, allcomplete."She looked so happy, so pretty, and full of girlish satisfaction, thatsister Pris couldn't bear to disturb the little plan, much as shedisapproved of it. They were poor, and every penny had to be counted.There were plenty of neighbors to gossip and criticise, and plenty offriends to make disagreeable remarks on any unusual extravagance.Pris saw things with the prudent eyes of thirty, but Kitty with theromantic eyes of seventeen; and the elder sister, in the kindness ofher heart, had no wish to sadden life to those bright young eyes,or deny the child a harmless pleasure. She sewed thoughtfully for aminute, then looked up, saying, with the smile that always assuredKitty the day was won,--"Get your things together, and we will see what can be done. Butremember, dear, that it is both bad taste and bad economy for poorpeople to try to ape the rich.""You're a perfect angel, Pris; so don't moralize. I'll run and get thedress, and we'll begin at once, for there is much to do, and onlytwo days to do it in." And Kitty skipped away, singing "LaurigerHoratius," at the top of her voice.Priscilla soon found that the girl's head was completely turned by theadvice and example of certain fashionable young neighbors. It was invain for Pris to remonstrate and warn."Just this once let me do as others do, and thoroughly enjoy myself."pleaded Kitty; and Pris yielded, saying to herself, "She shall haveher wish, and if she learns a lesson, neither time nor money will belost."So they snipped and sewed, and planned and pieced, going through allthe alternations of despair and triumph, worry and satisfaction, whichwomen undergo when a new suit is under way. Company kept coming, fornews of Kitty's expedition had flown abroad, and her young friendsmust just run in to hear about it, and ask what she was going to wear;while Kitty was so glad and proud to tell, and show, and enjoy herlittle triumph that many half hours were wasted, and the second dayfound much still to do.The lovely muslin didn't hold out, and Kitty sacrificed the waist tothe train, for a train she must have or the whole thing would be anutter failure. A little sacque was eked out, however, and when thefrills were on, it was "ravishing," as Kitty said, with a sigh ofmingled delight and fatigue. The gored skirt was a fearful job, as anyone who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify; and beforethe facing, even experienced Pris quailed.The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, it wasdiscovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was acatastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, thestores of her friends, and rummaged in vain. There was no time to sendto the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescuedher by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy toher because her life was spent for others. Some one suggested a stripof blue illusion,--and that could be got; but, alas! Kitty hadno money, for the gloves were already bought. Pris heard thelamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled hersister out of a slough of despond with two yards of "heavenly tulle.""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "I'll never wear that old muslin again; it's full of darns, up to myknees, and all out of fashion. So is my sacque; and as for my hat,though it does well enough here, it would be absurd for Class Day.""You don't expect an entirely new suit for this occasion,--do you?"asked Pris, anxiously."Yes, I do, and I'll tell you how I mean to get it. I've plannedeverything; for, though I hardly dreamed of going, I amused myself bythinking how I could manage if I did get invited.""Let us hear." And Pris took up her work with an air of resignation."First, my dress," began Kitty, perching herself on the arm of thesofa, and entering into the subject with enthusiasm. "I've got the tendollars grandpa sent me, and with eight of it I'm going to buyLizzie King's organdie muslin. She got it in Paris; but her auntprovidentially--no, unfortunately--died; so she can't wear it, andwants to get rid of it. She is bigger than I am, you know; so there isenough for a little mantle or sacque, for it isn't made up. The skirtis cut off and gored, with a splendid train--""My dear, you don't mean you are going to wear one of those absurd,new-fashioned dresses?" exclaimed Pris, lifting hands and eyes."I do! Nothing would induce me to go to Class Day without a train.It's been the desire of my heart to have one, and now I will, ifI never have another gown to my back!" returned Kitty, with immensedecision.Pris shook her head, and said, "Go on!" as if prepared for anyextravagance after that."We can make it ourselves," continued Kitty, "and trim it with thesame. It's white with blue stripes and daisies in the stripes; theloveliest thing you ever saw, and can't be got here. So simple,yet distingue, I know you'll like it. Next, my bonnet,"--here thesolemnity of Kitty's face and manner was charming to behold. "I shallmake it out of one of my new illusion undersleeves. I've never wornthem; and the puffed part will be a plenty for a little fly-awaybonnet of the latest style. I've got blue ribbons to tie it with, andhave only to look up some daisies for the inside. With my extra twodollars I shall buy my gloves, and pay my fares,--and there I am, allcomplete."She looked so happy, so pretty, and full of girlish satisfaction, thatsister Pris couldn't bear to disturb the little plan, much as shedisapproved of it. They were poor, and every penny had to be counted.There were plenty of neighbors to gossip and criticise, and plenty offriends to make disagreeable remarks on any unusual extravagance.Pris saw things with the prudent eyes of thirty, but Kitty with theromantic eyes of seventeen; and the elder sister, in the kindness ofher heart, had no wish to sadden life to those bright young eyes,or deny the child a harmless pleasure. She sewed thoughtfully for aminute, then looked up, saying, with the smile that always assuredKitty the day was won,--"Get your things together, and we will see what can be done. Butremember, dear, that it is both bad taste and bad economy for poorpeople to try to ape the rich.""You're a perfect angel, Pris; so don't moralize. I'll run and get thedress, and we'll begin at once, for there is much to do, and onlytwo days to do it in." And Kitty skipped away, singing "LaurigerHoratius," at the top of her voice.Priscilla soon found that the girl's head was completely turned by theadvice and example of certain fashionable young neighbors. It was invain for Pris to remonstrate and warn."Just this once let me do as others do, and thoroughly enjoy myself."pleaded Kitty; and Pris yielded, saying to herself, "She shall haveher wish, and if she learns a lesson, neither time nor money will belost."So they snipped and sewed, and planned and pieced, going through allthe alternations of despair and triumph, worry and satisfaction, whichwomen undergo when a new suit is under way. Company kept coming, fornews of Kitty's expedition had flown abroad, and her young friendsmust just run in to hear about it, and ask what she was going to wear;while Kitty was so glad and proud to tell, and show, and enjoy herlittle triumph that many half hours were wasted, and the second dayfound much still to do.The lovely muslin didn't hold out, and Kitty sacrificed the waist tothe train, for a train she must have or the whole thing would be anutter failure. A little sacque was eked out, however, and when thefrills were on, it was "ravishing," as Kitty said, with a sigh ofmingled delight and fatigue. The gored skirt was a fearful job, as anyone who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify; and beforethe facing, even experienced Pris quailed.The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, it wasdiscovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was acatastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, thestores of her friends, and rummaged in vain. There was no time to sendto the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescuedher by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy toher because her life was spent for others. Some one suggested a stripof blue illusion,--and that could be got; but, alas! Kitty hadno money, for the gloves were already bought. Pris heard thelamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled hersister out of a slough of despond with two yards of "heavenly tulle.""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "You don't expect an entirely new suit for this occasion,--do you?"asked Pris, anxiously."Yes, I do, and I'll tell you how I mean to get it. I've plannedeverything; for, though I hardly dreamed of going, I amused myself bythinking how I could manage if I did get invited.""Let us hear." And Pris took up her work with an air of resignation."First, my dress," began Kitty, perching herself on the arm of thesofa, and entering into the subject with enthusiasm. "I've got the tendollars grandpa sent me, and with eight of it I'm going to buyLizzie King's organdie muslin. She got it in Paris; but her auntprovidentially--no, unfortunately--died; so she can't wear it, andwants to get rid of it. She is bigger than I am, you know; so there isenough for a little mantle or sacque, for it isn't made up. The skirtis cut off and gored, with a splendid train--""My dear, you don't mean you are going to wear one of those absurd,new-fashioned dresses?" exclaimed Pris, lifting hands and eyes."I do! Nothing would induce me to go to Class Day without a train.It's been the desire of my heart to have one, and now I will, ifI never have another gown to my back!" returned Kitty, with immensedecision.Pris shook her head, and said, "Go on!" as if prepared for anyextravagance after that."We can make it ourselves," continued Kitty, "and trim it with thesame. It's white with blue stripes and daisies in the stripes; theloveliest thing you ever saw, and can't be got here. So simple,yet distingue, I know you'll like it. Next, my bonnet,"--here thesolemnity of Kitty's face and manner was charming to behold. "I shallmake it out of one of my new illusion undersleeves. I've never wornthem; and the puffed part will be a plenty for a little fly-awaybonnet of the latest style. I've got blue ribbons to tie it with, andhave only to look up some daisies for the inside. With my extra twodollars I shall buy my gloves, and pay my fares,--and there I am, allcomplete."She looked so happy, so pretty, and full of girlish satisfaction, thatsister Pris couldn't bear to disturb the little plan, much as shedisapproved of it. They were poor, and every penny had to be counted.There were plenty of neighbors to gossip and criticise, and plenty offriends to make disagreeable remarks on any unusual extravagance.Pris saw things with the prudent eyes of thirty, but Kitty with theromantic eyes of seventeen; and the elder sister, in the kindness ofher heart, had no wish to sadden life to those bright young eyes,or deny the child a harmless pleasure. She sewed thoughtfully for aminute, then looked up, saying, with the smile that always assuredKitty the day was won,--"Get your things together, and we will see what can be done. Butremember, dear, that it is both bad taste and bad economy for poorpeople to try to ape the rich.""You're a perfect angel, Pris; so don't moralize. I'll run and get thedress, and we'll begin at once, for there is much to do, and onlytwo days to do it in." And Kitty skipped away, singing "LaurigerHoratius," at the top of her voice.Priscilla soon found that the girl's head was completely turned by theadvice and example of certain fashionable young neighbors. It was invain for Pris to remonstrate and warn."Just this once let me do as others do, and thoroughly enjoy myself."pleaded Kitty; and Pris yielded, saying to herself, "She shall haveher wish, and if she learns a lesson, neither time nor money will belost."So they snipped and sewed, and planned and pieced, going through allthe alternations of despair and triumph, worry and satisfaction, whichwomen undergo when a new suit is under way. Company kept coming, fornews of Kitty's expedition had flown abroad, and her young friendsmust just run in to hear about it, and ask what she was going to wear;while Kitty was so glad and proud to tell, and show, and enjoy herlittle triumph that many half hours were wasted, and the second dayfound much still to do.The lovely muslin didn't hold out, and Kitty sacrificed the waist tothe train, for a train she must have or the whole thing would be anutter failure. A little sacque was eked out, however, and when thefrills were on, it was "ravishing," as Kitty said, with a sigh ofmingled delight and fatigue. The gored skirt was a fearful job, as anyone who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify; and beforethe facing, even experienced Pris quailed.The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, it wasdiscovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was acatastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, thestores of her friends, and rummaged in vain. There was no time to sendto the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescuedher by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy toher because her life was spent for others. Some one suggested a stripof blue illusion,--and that could be got; but, alas! Kitty hadno money, for the gloves were already bought. Pris heard thelamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled hersister out of a slough of despond with two yards of "heavenly tulle.""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "Yes, I do, and I'll tell you how I mean to get it. I've plannedeverything; for, though I hardly dreamed of going, I amused myself bythinking how I could manage if I did get invited.""Let us hear." And Pris took up her work with an air of resignation."First, my dress," began Kitty, perching herself on the arm of thesofa, and entering into the subject with enthusiasm. "I've got the tendollars grandpa sent me, and with eight of it I'm going to buyLizzie King's organdie muslin. She got it in Paris; but her auntprovidentially--no, unfortunately--died; so she can't wear it, andwants to get rid of it. She is bigger than I am, you know; so there isenough for a little mantle or sacque, for it isn't made up. The skirtis cut off and gored, with a splendid train--""My dear, you don't mean you are going to wear one of those absurd,new-fashioned dresses?" exclaimed Pris, lifting hands and eyes."I do! Nothing would induce me to go to Class Day without a train.It's been the desire of my heart to have one, and now I will, ifI never have another gown to my back!" returned Kitty, with immensedecision.Pris shook her head, and said, "Go on!" as if prepared for anyextravagance after that."We can make it ourselves," continued Kitty, "and trim it with thesame. It's white with blue stripes and daisies in the stripes; theloveliest thing you ever saw, and can't be got here. So simple,yet distingue, I know you'll like it. Next, my bonnet,"--here thesolemnity of Kitty's face and manner was charming to behold. "I shallmake it out of one of my new illusion undersleeves. I've never wornthem; and the puffed part will be a plenty for a little fly-awaybonnet of the latest style. I've got blue ribbons to tie it with, andhave only to look up some daisies for the inside. With my extra twodollars I shall buy my gloves, and pay my fares,--and there I am, allcomplete."She looked so happy, so pretty, and full of girlish satisfaction, thatsister Pris couldn't bear to disturb the little plan, much as shedisapproved of it. They were poor, and every penny had to be counted.There were plenty of neighbors to gossip and criticise, and plenty offriends to make disagreeable remarks on any unusual extravagance.Pris saw things with the prudent eyes of thirty, but Kitty with theromantic eyes of seventeen; and the elder sister, in the kindness ofher heart, had no wish to sadden life to those bright young eyes,or deny the child a harmless pleasure. She sewed thoughtfully for aminute, then looked up, saying, with the smile that always assuredKitty the day was won,--"Get your things together, and we will see what can be done. Butremember, dear, that it is both bad taste and bad economy for poorpeople to try to ape the rich.""You're a perfect angel, Pris; so don't moralize. I'll run and get thedress, and we'll begin at once, for there is much to do, and onlytwo days to do it in." And Kitty skipped away, singing "LaurigerHoratius," at the top of her voice.Priscilla soon found that the girl's head was completely turned by theadvice and example of certain fashionable young neighbors. It was invain for Pris to remonstrate and warn."Just this once let me do as others do, and thoroughly enjoy myself."pleaded Kitty; and Pris yielded, saying to herself, "She shall haveher wish, and if she learns a lesson, neither time nor money will belost."So they snipped and sewed, and planned and pieced, going through allthe alternations of despair and triumph, worry and satisfaction, whichwomen undergo when a new suit is under way. Company kept coming, fornews of Kitty's expedition had flown abroad, and her young friendsmust just run in to hear about it, and ask what she was going to wear;while Kitty was so glad and proud to tell, and show, and enjoy herlittle triumph that many half hours were wasted, and the second dayfound much still to do.The lovely muslin didn't hold out, and Kitty sacrificed the waist tothe train, for a train she must have or the whole thing would be anutter failure. A little sacque was eked out, however, and when thefrills were on, it was "ravishing," as Kitty said, with a sigh ofmingled delight and fatigue. The gored skirt was a fearful job, as anyone who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify; and beforethe facing, even experienced Pris quailed.The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, it wasdiscovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was acatastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, thestores of her friends, and rummaged in vain. There was no time to sendto the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescuedher by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy toher because her life was spent for others. Some one suggested a stripof blue illusion,--and that could be got; but, alas! Kitty hadno money, for the gloves were already bought. Pris heard thelamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled hersister out of a slough of despond with two yards of "heavenly tulle.""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "Let us hear." And Pris took up her work with an air of resignation."First, my dress," began Kitty, perching herself on the arm of thesofa, and entering into the subject with enthusiasm. "I've got the tendollars grandpa sent me, and with eight of it I'm going to buyLizzie King's organdie muslin. She got it in Paris; but her auntprovidentially--no, unfortunately--died; so she can't wear it, andwants to get rid of it. She is bigger than I am, you know; so there isenough for a little mantle or sacque, for it isn't made up. The skirtis cut off and gored, with a splendid train--""My dear, you don't mean you are going to wear one of those absurd,new-fashioned dresses?" exclaimed Pris, lifting hands and eyes."I do! Nothing would induce me to go to Class Day without a train.It's been the desire of my heart to have one, and now I will, ifI never have another gown to my back!" returned Kitty, with immensedecision.Pris shook her head, and said, "Go on!" as if prepared for anyextravagance after that."We can make it ourselves," continued Kitty, "and trim it with thesame. It's white with blue stripes and daisies in the stripes; theloveliest thing you ever saw, and can't be got here. So simple,yet distingue, I know you'll like it. Next, my bonnet,"--here thesolemnity of Kitty's face and manner was charming to behold. "I shallmake it out of one of my new illusion undersleeves. I've never wornthem; and the puffed part will be a plenty for a little fly-awaybonnet of the latest style. I've got blue ribbons to tie it with, andhave only to look up some daisies for the inside. With my extra twodollars I shall buy my gloves, and pay my fares,--and there I am, allcomplete."She looked so happy, so pretty, and full of girlish satisfaction, thatsister Pris couldn't bear to disturb the little plan, much as shedisapproved of it. They were poor, and every penny had to be counted.There were plenty of neighbors to gossip and criticise, and plenty offriends to make disagreeable remarks on any unusual extravagance.Pris saw things with the prudent eyes of thirty, but Kitty with theromantic eyes of seventeen; and the elder sister, in the kindness ofher heart, had no wish to sadden life to those bright young eyes,or deny the child a harmless pleasure. She sewed thoughtfully for aminute, then looked up, saying, with the smile that always assuredKitty the day was won,--"Get your things together, and we will see what can be done. Butremember, dear, that it is both bad taste and bad economy for poorpeople to try to ape the rich.""You're a perfect angel, Pris; so don't moralize. I'll run and get thedress, and we'll begin at once, for there is much to do, and onlytwo days to do it in." And Kitty skipped away, singing "LaurigerHoratius," at the top of her voice.Priscilla soon found that the girl's head was completely turned by theadvice and example of certain fashionable young neighbors. It was invain for Pris to remonstrate and warn."Just this once let me do as others do, and thoroughly enjoy myself."pleaded Kitty; and Pris yielded, saying to herself, "She shall haveher wish, and if she learns a lesson, neither time nor money will belost."So they snipped and sewed, and planned and pieced, going through allthe alternations of despair and triumph, worry and satisfaction, whichwomen undergo when a new suit is under way. Company kept coming, fornews of Kitty's expedition had flown abroad, and her young friendsmust just run in to hear about it, and ask what she was going to wear;while Kitty was so glad and proud to tell, and show, and enjoy herlittle triumph that many half hours were wasted, and the second dayfound much still to do.The lovely muslin didn't hold out, and Kitty sacrificed the waist tothe train, for a train she must have or the whole thing would be anutter failure. A little sacque was eked out, however, and when thefrills were on, it was "ravishing," as Kitty said, with a sigh ofmingled delight and fatigue. The gored skirt was a fearful job, as anyone who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify; and beforethe facing, even experienced Pris quailed.The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, it wasdiscovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was acatastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, thestores of her friends, and rummaged in vain. There was no time to sendto the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescuedher by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy toher because her life was spent for others. Some one suggested a stripof blue illusion,--and that could be got; but, alas! Kitty hadno money, for the gloves were already bought. Pris heard thelamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled hersister out of a slough of despond with two yards of "heavenly tulle.""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "First, my dress," began Kitty, perching herself on the arm of thesofa, and entering into the subject with enthusiasm. "I've got the tendollars grandpa sent me, and with eight of it I'm going to buyLizzie King's organdie muslin. She got it in Paris; but her auntprovidentially--no, unfortunately--died; so she can't wear it, andwants to get rid of it. She is bigger than I am, you know; so there isenough for a little mantle or sacque, for it isn't made up. The skirtis cut off and gored, with a splendid train--""My dear, you don't mean you are going to wear one of those absurd,new-fashioned dresses?" exclaimed Pris, lifting hands and eyes."I do! Nothing would induce me to go to Class Day without a train.It's been the desire of my heart to have one, and now I will, ifI never have another gown to my back!" returned Kitty, with immensedecision.Pris shook her head, and said, "Go on!" as if prepared for anyextravagance after that."We can make it ourselves," continued Kitty, "and trim it with thesame. It's white with blue stripes and daisies in the stripes; theloveliest thing you ever saw, and can't be got here. So simple,yet distingue, I know you'll like it. Next, my bonnet,"--here thesolemnity of Kitty's face and manner was charming to behold. "I shallmake it out of one of my new illusion undersleeves. I've never wornthem; and the puffed part will be a plenty for a little fly-awaybonnet of the latest style. I've got blue ribbons to tie it with, andhave only to look up some daisies for the inside. With my extra twodollars I shall buy my gloves, and pay my fares,--and there I am, allcomplete."She looked so happy, so pretty, and full of girlish satisfaction, thatsister Pris couldn't bear to disturb the little plan, much as shedisapproved of it. They were poor, and every penny had to be counted.There were plenty of neighbors to gossip and criticise, and plenty offriends to make disagreeable remarks on any unusual extravagance.Pris saw things with the prudent eyes of thirty, but Kitty with theromantic eyes of seventeen; and the elder sister, in the kindness ofher heart, had no wish to sadden life to those bright young eyes,or deny the child a harmless pleasure. She sewed thoughtfully for aminute, then looked up, saying, with the smile that always assuredKitty the day was won,--"Get your things together, and we will see what can be done. Butremember, dear, that it is both bad taste and bad economy for poorpeople to try to ape the rich.""You're a perfect angel, Pris; so don't moralize. I'll run and get thedress, and we'll begin at once, for there is much to do, and onlytwo days to do it in." And Kitty skipped away, singing "LaurigerHoratius," at the top of her voice.Priscilla soon found that the girl's head was completely turned by theadvice and example of certain fashionable young neighbors. It was invain for Pris to remonstrate and warn."Just this once let me do as others do, and thoroughly enjoy myself."pleaded Kitty; and Pris yielded, saying to herself, "She shall haveher wish, and if she learns a lesson, neither time nor money will belost."So they snipped and sewed, and planned and pieced, going through allthe alternations of despair and triumph, worry and satisfaction, whichwomen undergo when a new suit is under way. Company kept coming, fornews of Kitty's expedition had flown abroad, and her young friendsmust just run in to hear about it, and ask what she was going to wear;while Kitty was so glad and proud to tell, and show, and enjoy herlittle triumph that many half hours were wasted, and the second dayfound much still to do.The lovely muslin didn't hold out, and Kitty sacrificed the waist tothe train, for a train she must have or the whole thing would be anutter failure. A little sacque was eked out, however, and when thefrills were on, it was "ravishing," as Kitty said, with a sigh ofmingled delight and fatigue. The gored skirt was a fearful job, as anyone who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify; and beforethe facing, even experienced Pris quailed.The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, it wasdiscovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was acatastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, thestores of her friends, and rummaged in vain. There was no time to sendto the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescuedher by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy toher because her life was spent for others. Some one suggested a stripof blue illusion,--and that could be got; but, alas! Kitty hadno money, for the gloves were already bought. Pris heard thelamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled hersister out of a slough of despond with two yards of "heavenly tulle.""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "My dear, you don't mean you are going to wear one of those absurd,new-fashioned dresses?" exclaimed Pris, lifting hands and eyes."I do! Nothing would induce me to go to Class Day without a train.It's been the desire of my heart to have one, and now I will, ifI never have another gown to my back!" returned Kitty, with immensedecision.Pris shook her head, and said, "Go on!" as if prepared for anyextravagance after that."We can make it ourselves," continued Kitty, "and trim it with thesame. It's white with blue stripes and daisies in the stripes; theloveliest thing you ever saw, and can't be got here. So simple,yet distingue, I know you'll like it. Next, my bonnet,"--here thesolemnity of Kitty's face and manner was charming to behold. "I shallmake it out of one of my new illusion undersleeves. I've never wornthem; and the puffed part will be a plenty for a little fly-awaybonnet of the latest style. I've got blue ribbons to tie it with, andhave only to look up some daisies for the inside. With my extra twodollars I shall buy my gloves, and pay my fares,--and there I am, allcomplete."She looked so happy, so pretty, and full of girlish satisfaction, thatsister Pris couldn't bear to disturb the little plan, much as shedisapproved of it. They were poor, and every penny had to be counted.There were plenty of neighbors to gossip and criticise, and plenty offriends to make disagreeable remarks on any unusual extravagance.Pris saw things with the prudent eyes of thirty, but Kitty with theromantic eyes of seventeen; and the elder sister, in the kindness ofher heart, had no wish to sadden life to those bright young eyes,or deny the child a harmless pleasure. She sewed thoughtfully for aminute, then looked up, saying, with the smile that always assuredKitty the day was won,--"Get your things together, and we will see what can be done. Butremember, dear, that it is both bad taste and bad economy for poorpeople to try to ape the rich.""You're a perfect angel, Pris; so don't moralize. I'll run and get thedress, and we'll begin at once, for there is much to do, and onlytwo days to do it in." And Kitty skipped away, singing "LaurigerHoratius," at the top of her voice.Priscilla soon found that the girl's head was completely turned by theadvice and example of certain fashionable young neighbors. It was invain for Pris to remonstrate and warn."Just this once let me do as others do, and thoroughly enjoy myself."pleaded Kitty; and Pris yielded, saying to herself, "She shall haveher wish, and if she learns a lesson, neither time nor money will belost."So they snipped and sewed, and planned and pieced, going through allthe alternations of despair and triumph, worry and satisfaction, whichwomen undergo when a new suit is under way. Company kept coming, fornews of Kitty's expedition had flown abroad, and her young friendsmust just run in to hear about it, and ask what she was going to wear;while Kitty was so glad and proud to tell, and show, and enjoy herlittle triumph that many half hours were wasted, and the second dayfound much still to do.The lovely muslin didn't hold out, and Kitty sacrificed the waist tothe train, for a train she must have or the whole thing would be anutter failure. A little sacque was eked out, however, and when thefrills were on, it was "ravishing," as Kitty said, with a sigh ofmingled delight and fatigue. The gored skirt was a fearful job, as anyone who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify; and beforethe facing, even experienced Pris quailed.The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, it wasdiscovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was acatastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, thestores of her friends, and rummaged in vain. There was no time to sendto the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescuedher by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy toher because her life was spent for others. Some one suggested a stripof blue illusion,--and that could be got; but, alas! Kitty hadno money, for the gloves were already bought. Pris heard thelamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled hersister out of a slough of despond with two yards of "heavenly tulle.""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "I do! Nothing would induce me to go to Class Day without a train.It's been the desire of my heart to have one, and now I will, ifI never have another gown to my back!" returned Kitty, with immensedecision.Pris shook her head, and said, "Go on!" as if prepared for anyextravagance after that."We can make it ourselves," continued Kitty, "and trim it with thesame. It's white with blue stripes and daisies in the stripes; theloveliest thing you ever saw, and can't be got here. So simple,yet distingue, I know you'll like it. Next, my bonnet,"--here thesolemnity of Kitty's face and manner was charming to behold. "I shallmake it out of one of my new illusion undersleeves. I've never wornthem; and the puffed part will be a plenty for a little fly-awaybonnet of the latest style. I've got blue ribbons to tie it with, andhave only to look up some daisies for the inside. With my extra twodollars I shall buy my gloves, and pay my fares,--and there I am, allcomplete."She looked so happy, so pretty, and full of girlish satisfaction, thatsister Pris couldn't bear to disturb the little plan, much as shedisapproved of it. They were poor, and every penny had to be counted.There were plenty of neighbors to gossip and criticise, and plenty offriends to make disagreeable remarks on any unusual extravagance.Pris saw things with the prudent eyes of thirty, but Kitty with theromantic eyes of seventeen; and the elder sister, in the kindness ofher heart, had no wish to sadden life to those bright young eyes,or deny the child a harmless pleasure. She sewed thoughtfully for aminute, then looked up, saying, with the smile that always assuredKitty the day was won,--"Get your things together, and we will see what can be done. Butremember, dear, that it is both bad taste and bad economy for poorpeople to try to ape the rich.""You're a perfect angel, Pris; so don't moralize. I'll run and get thedress, and we'll begin at once, for there is much to do, and onlytwo days to do it in." And Kitty skipped away, singing "LaurigerHoratius," at the top of her voice.Priscilla soon found that the girl's head was completely turned by theadvice and example of certain fashionable young neighbors. It was invain for Pris to remonstrate and warn."Just this once let me do as others do, and thoroughly enjoy myself."pleaded Kitty; and Pris yielded, saying to herself, "She shall haveher wish, and if she learns a lesson, neither time nor money will belost."So they snipped and sewed, and planned and pieced, going through allthe alternations of despair and triumph, worry and satisfaction, whichwomen undergo when a new suit is under way. Company kept coming, fornews of Kitty's expedition had flown abroad, and her young friendsmust just run in to hear about it, and ask what she was going to wear;while Kitty was so glad and proud to tell, and show, and enjoy herlittle triumph that many half hours were wasted, and the second dayfound much still to do.The lovely muslin didn't hold out, and Kitty sacrificed the waist tothe train, for a train she must have or the whole thing would be anutter failure. A little sacque was eked out, however, and when thefrills were on, it was "ravishing," as Kitty said, with a sigh ofmingled delight and fatigue. The gored skirt was a fearful job, as anyone who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify; and beforethe facing, even experienced Pris quailed.The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, it wasdiscovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was acatastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, thestores of her friends, and rummaged in vain. There was no time to sendto the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescuedher by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy toher because her life was spent for others. Some one suggested a stripof blue illusion,--and that could be got; but, alas! Kitty hadno money, for the gloves were already bought. Pris heard thelamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled hersister out of a slough of despond with two yards of "heavenly tulle.""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog Pris shook her head, and said, "Go on!" as if prepared for anyextravagance after that."We can make it ourselves," continued Kitty, "and trim it with thesame. It's white with blue stripes and daisies in the stripes; theloveliest thing you ever saw, and can't be got here. So simple,yet distingue, I know you'll like it. Next, my bonnet,"--here thesolemnity of Kitty's face and manner was charming to behold. "I shallmake it out of one of my new illusion undersleeves. I've never wornthem; and the puffed part will be a plenty for a little fly-awaybonnet of the latest style. I've got blue ribbons to tie it with, andhave only to look up some daisies for the inside. With my extra twodollars I shall buy my gloves, and pay my fares,--and there I am, allcomplete."She looked so happy, so pretty, and full of girlish satisfaction, thatsister Pris couldn't bear to disturb the little plan, much as shedisapproved of it. They were poor, and every penny had to be counted.There were plenty of neighbors to gossip and criticise, and plenty offriends to make disagreeable remarks on any unusual extravagance.Pris saw things with the prudent eyes of thirty, but Kitty with theromantic eyes of seventeen; and the elder sister, in the kindness ofher heart, had no wish to sadden life to those bright young eyes,or deny the child a harmless pleasure. She sewed thoughtfully for aminute, then looked up, saying, with the smile that always assuredKitty the day was won,--"Get your things together, and we will see what can be done. Butremember, dear, that it is both bad taste and bad economy for poorpeople to try to ape the rich.""You're a perfect angel, Pris; so don't moralize. I'll run and get thedress, and we'll begin at once, for there is much to do, and onlytwo days to do it in." And Kitty skipped away, singing "LaurigerHoratius," at the top of her voice.Priscilla soon found that the girl's head was completely turned by theadvice and example of certain fashionable young neighbors. It was invain for Pris to remonstrate and warn."Just this once let me do as others do, and thoroughly enjoy myself."pleaded Kitty; and Pris yielded, saying to herself, "She shall haveher wish, and if she learns a lesson, neither time nor money will belost."So they snipped and sewed, and planned and pieced, going through allthe alternations of despair and triumph, worry and satisfaction, whichwomen undergo when a new suit is under way. Company kept coming, fornews of Kitty's expedition had flown abroad, and her young friendsmust just run in to hear about it, and ask what she was going to wear;while Kitty was so glad and proud to tell, and show, and enjoy herlittle triumph that many half hours were wasted, and the second dayfound much still to do.The lovely muslin didn't hold out, and Kitty sacrificed the waist tothe train, for a train she must have or the whole thing would be anutter failure. A little sacque was eked out, however, and when thefrills were on, it was "ravishing," as Kitty said, with a sigh ofmingled delight and fatigue. The gored skirt was a fearful job, as anyone who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify; and beforethe facing, even experienced Pris quailed.The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, it wasdiscovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was acatastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, thestores of her friends, and rummaged in vain. There was no time to sendto the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescuedher by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy toher because her life was spent for others. Some one suggested a stripof blue illusion,--and that could be got; but, alas! Kitty hadno money, for the gloves were already bought. Pris heard thelamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled hersister out of a slough of despond with two yards of "heavenly tulle.""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "We can make it ourselves," continued Kitty, "and trim it with thesame. It's white with blue stripes and daisies in the stripes; theloveliest thing you ever saw, and can't be got here. So simple,yet distingue, I know you'll like it. Next, my bonnet,"--here thesolemnity of Kitty's face and manner was charming to behold. "I shallmake it out of one of my new illusion undersleeves. I've never wornthem; and the puffed part will be a plenty for a little fly-awaybonnet of the latest style. I've got blue ribbons to tie it with, andhave only to look up some daisies for the inside. With my extra twodollars I shall buy my gloves, and pay my fares,--and there I am, allcomplete."She looked so happy, so pretty, and full of girlish satisfaction, thatsister Pris couldn't bear to disturb the little plan, much as shedisapproved of it. They were poor, and every penny had to be counted.There were plenty of neighbors to gossip and criticise, and plenty offriends to make disagreeable remarks on any unusual extravagance.Pris saw things with the prudent eyes of thirty, but Kitty with theromantic eyes of seventeen; and the elder sister, in the kindness ofher heart, had no wish to sadden life to those bright young eyes,or deny the child a harmless pleasure. She sewed thoughtfully for aminute, then looked up, saying, with the smile that always assuredKitty the day was won,--"Get your things together, and we will see what can be done. Butremember, dear, that it is both bad taste and bad economy for poorpeople to try to ape the rich.""You're a perfect angel, Pris; so don't moralize. I'll run and get thedress, and we'll begin at once, for there is much to do, and onlytwo days to do it in." And Kitty skipped away, singing "LaurigerHoratius," at the top of her voice.Priscilla soon found that the girl's head was completely turned by theadvice and example of certain fashionable young neighbors. It was invain for Pris to remonstrate and warn."Just this once let me do as others do, and thoroughly enjoy myself."pleaded Kitty; and Pris yielded, saying to herself, "She shall haveher wish, and if she learns a lesson, neither time nor money will belost."So they snipped and sewed, and planned and pieced, going through allthe alternations of despair and triumph, worry and satisfaction, whichwomen undergo when a new suit is under way. Company kept coming, fornews of Kitty's expedition had flown abroad, and her young friendsmust just run in to hear about it, and ask what she was going to wear;while Kitty was so glad and proud to tell, and show, and enjoy herlittle triumph that many half hours were wasted, and the second dayfound much still to do.The lovely muslin didn't hold out, and Kitty sacrificed the waist tothe train, for a train she must have or the whole thing would be anutter failure. A little sacque was eked out, however, and when thefrills were on, it was "ravishing," as Kitty said, with a sigh ofmingled delight and fatigue. The gored skirt was a fearful job, as anyone who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify; and beforethe facing, even experienced Pris quailed.The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, it wasdiscovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was acatastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, thestores of her friends, and rummaged in vain. There was no time to sendto the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescuedher by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy toher because her life was spent for others. Some one suggested a stripof blue illusion,--and that could be got; but, alas! Kitty hadno money, for the gloves were already bought. Pris heard thelamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled hersister out of a slough of despond with two yards of "heavenly tulle.""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog She looked so happy, so pretty, and full of girlish satisfaction, thatsister Pris couldn't bear to disturb the little plan, much as shedisapproved of it. They were poor, and every penny had to be counted.There were plenty of neighbors to gossip and criticise, and plenty offriends to make disagreeable remarks on any unusual extravagance.Pris saw things with the prudent eyes of thirty, but Kitty with theromantic eyes of seventeen; and the elder sister, in the kindness ofher heart, had no wish to sadden life to those bright young eyes,or deny the child a harmless pleasure. She sewed thoughtfully for aminute, then looked up, saying, with the smile that always assuredKitty the day was won,--"Get your things together, and we will see what can be done. Butremember, dear, that it is both bad taste and bad economy for poorpeople to try to ape the rich.""You're a perfect angel, Pris; so don't moralize. I'll run and get thedress, and we'll begin at once, for there is much to do, and onlytwo days to do it in." And Kitty skipped away, singing "LaurigerHoratius," at the top of her voice.Priscilla soon found that the girl's head was completely turned by theadvice and example of certain fashionable young neighbors. It was invain for Pris to remonstrate and warn."Just this once let me do as others do, and thoroughly enjoy myself."pleaded Kitty; and Pris yielded, saying to herself, "She shall haveher wish, and if she learns a lesson, neither time nor money will belost."So they snipped and sewed, and planned and pieced, going through allthe alternations of despair and triumph, worry and satisfaction, whichwomen undergo when a new suit is under way. Company kept coming, fornews of Kitty's expedition had flown abroad, and her young friendsmust just run in to hear about it, and ask what she was going to wear;while Kitty was so glad and proud to tell, and show, and enjoy herlittle triumph that many half hours were wasted, and the second dayfound much still to do.The lovely muslin didn't hold out, and Kitty sacrificed the waist tothe train, for a train she must have or the whole thing would be anutter failure. A little sacque was eked out, however, and when thefrills were on, it was "ravishing," as Kitty said, with a sigh ofmingled delight and fatigue. The gored skirt was a fearful job, as anyone who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify; and beforethe facing, even experienced Pris quailed.The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, it wasdiscovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was acatastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, thestores of her friends, and rummaged in vain. There was no time to sendto the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescuedher by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy toher because her life was spent for others. Some one suggested a stripof blue illusion,--and that could be got; but, alas! Kitty hadno money, for the gloves were already bought. Pris heard thelamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled hersister out of a slough of despond with two yards of "heavenly tulle.""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "Get your things together, and we will see what can be done. Butremember, dear, that it is both bad taste and bad economy for poorpeople to try to ape the rich.""You're a perfect angel, Pris; so don't moralize. I'll run and get thedress, and we'll begin at once, for there is much to do, and onlytwo days to do it in." And Kitty skipped away, singing "LaurigerHoratius," at the top of her voice.Priscilla soon found that the girl's head was completely turned by theadvice and example of certain fashionable young neighbors. It was invain for Pris to remonstrate and warn."Just this once let me do as others do, and thoroughly enjoy myself."pleaded Kitty; and Pris yielded, saying to herself, "She shall haveher wish, and if she learns a lesson, neither time nor money will belost."So they snipped and sewed, and planned and pieced, going through allthe alternations of despair and triumph, worry and satisfaction, whichwomen undergo when a new suit is under way. Company kept coming, fornews of Kitty's expedition had flown abroad, and her young friendsmust just run in to hear about it, and ask what she was going to wear;while Kitty was so glad and proud to tell, and show, and enjoy herlittle triumph that many half hours were wasted, and the second dayfound much still to do.The lovely muslin didn't hold out, and Kitty sacrificed the waist tothe train, for a train she must have or the whole thing would be anutter failure. A little sacque was eked out, however, and when thefrills were on, it was "ravishing," as Kitty said, with a sigh ofmingled delight and fatigue. The gored skirt was a fearful job, as anyone who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify; and beforethe facing, even experienced Pris quailed.The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, it wasdiscovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was acatastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, thestores of her friends, and rummaged in vain. There was no time to sendto the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescuedher by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy toher because her life was spent for others. Some one suggested a stripof blue illusion,--and that could be got; but, alas! Kitty hadno money, for the gloves were already bought. Pris heard thelamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled hersister out of a slough of despond with two yards of "heavenly tulle.""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "You're a perfect angel, Pris; so don't moralize. I'll run and get thedress, and we'll begin at once, for there is much to do, and onlytwo days to do it in." And Kitty skipped away, singing "LaurigerHoratius," at the top of her voice.Priscilla soon found that the girl's head was completely turned by theadvice and example of certain fashionable young neighbors. It was invain for Pris to remonstrate and warn."Just this once let me do as others do, and thoroughly enjoy myself."pleaded Kitty; and Pris yielded, saying to herself, "She shall haveher wish, and if she learns a lesson, neither time nor money will belost."So they snipped and sewed, and planned and pieced, going through allthe alternations of despair and triumph, worry and satisfaction, whichwomen undergo when a new suit is under way. Company kept coming, fornews of Kitty's expedition had flown abroad, and her young friendsmust just run in to hear about it, and ask what she was going to wear;while Kitty was so glad and proud to tell, and show, and enjoy herlittle triumph that many half hours were wasted, and the second dayfound much still to do.The lovely muslin didn't hold out, and Kitty sacrificed the waist tothe train, for a train she must have or the whole thing would be anutter failure. A little sacque was eked out, however, and when thefrills were on, it was "ravishing," as Kitty said, with a sigh ofmingled delight and fatigue. The gored skirt was a fearful job, as anyone who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify; and beforethe facing, even experienced Pris quailed.The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, it wasdiscovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was acatastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, thestores of her friends, and rummaged in vain. There was no time to sendto the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescuedher by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy toher because her life was spent for others. Some one suggested a stripof blue illusion,--and that could be got; but, alas! Kitty hadno money, for the gloves were already bought. Pris heard thelamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled hersister out of a slough of despond with two yards of "heavenly tulle.""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog Priscilla soon found that the girl's head was completely turned by theadvice and example of certain fashionable young neighbors. It was invain for Pris to remonstrate and warn."Just this once let me do as others do, and thoroughly enjoy myself."pleaded Kitty; and Pris yielded, saying to herself, "She shall haveher wish, and if she learns a lesson, neither time nor money will belost."So they snipped and sewed, and planned and pieced, going through allthe alternations of despair and triumph, worry and satisfaction, whichwomen undergo when a new suit is under way. Company kept coming, fornews of Kitty's expedition had flown abroad, and her young friendsmust just run in to hear about it, and ask what she was going to wear;while Kitty was so glad and proud to tell, and show, and enjoy herlittle triumph that many half hours were wasted, and the second dayfound much still to do.The lovely muslin didn't hold out, and Kitty sacrificed the waist tothe train, for a train she must have or the whole thing would be anutter failure. A little sacque was eked out, however, and when thefrills were on, it was "ravishing," as Kitty said, with a sigh ofmingled delight and fatigue. The gored skirt was a fearful job, as anyone who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify; and beforethe facing, even experienced Pris quailed.The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, it wasdiscovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was acatastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, thestores of her friends, and rummaged in vain. There was no time to sendto the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescuedher by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy toher because her life was spent for others. Some one suggested a stripof blue illusion,--and that could be got; but, alas! Kitty hadno money, for the gloves were already bought. Pris heard thelamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled hersister out of a slough of despond with two yards of "heavenly tulle.""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time.

They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "Just this once let me do as others do, and thoroughly enjoy myself."pleaded Kitty; and Pris yielded, saying to herself, "She shall haveher wish, and if she learns a lesson, neither time nor money will belost."So they snipped and sewed, and planned and pieced, going through allthe alternations of despair and triumph, worry and satisfaction, whichwomen undergo when a new suit is under way. Company kept coming, fornews of Kitty's expedition had flown abroad, and her young friendsmust just run in to hear about it, and ask what she was going to wear;while Kitty was so glad and proud to tell, and show, and enjoy herlittle triumph that many half hours were wasted, and the second dayfound much still to do.The lovely muslin didn't hold out, and Kitty sacrificed the waist tothe train, for a train she must have or the whole thing would be anutter failure. A little sacque was eked out, however, and when thefrills were on, it was "ravishing," as Kitty said, with a sigh ofmingled delight and fatigue. The gored skirt was a fearful job, as anyone who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify; and beforethe facing, even experienced Pris quailed.The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, it wasdiscovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was acatastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, thestores of her friends, and rummaged in vain. There was no time to sendto the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescuedher by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy toher because her life was spent for others. Some one suggested a stripof blue illusion,--and that could be got; but, alas! Kitty hadno money, for the gloves were already bought. Pris heard thelamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled hersister out of a slough of despond with two yards of "heavenly tulle.""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . .

I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog The lovely muslin didn't hold out, and Kitty sacrificed the waist tothe train, for a train she must have or the whole thing would be anutter failure. A little sacque was eked out, however, and when thefrills were on, it was "ravishing," as Kitty said, with a sigh ofmingled delight and fatigue. The gored skirt was a fearful job, as anyone who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify; and beforethe facing, even experienced Pris quailed.The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, it wasdiscovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was acatastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, thestores of her friends, and rummaged in vain. There was no time to sendto the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescuedher by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy toher because her life was spent for others. Some one suggested a stripof blue illusion,--and that could be got; but, alas! Kitty hadno money, for the gloves were already bought. Pris heard thelamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled hersister out of a slough of despond with two yards of "heavenly tulle.""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late.

I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite.

But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, it wasdiscovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was acatastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, thestores of her friends, and rummaged in vain. There was no time to sendto the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescuedher by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy toher because her life was spent for others. Some one suggested a stripof blue illusion,--and that could be got; but, alas! Kitty hadno money, for the gloves were already bought. Pris heard thelamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled hersister out of a slough of despond with two yards of "heavenly tulle.""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves!

"He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in thispoverty-stricken town," sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass, andfervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion overnight."I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing.

But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "I see plenty just like those on your dress," answered Pris, noddingtoward the meadow full of young whiteweed."Pris, you're a treasure! I'll wear real ones; they keep well, I know,and are so common I can refresh my bonnet anywhere. It's a splendididea."Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation.

An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog Away rushed Kitty to return with an apron full of American daisies. Apretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle ofbright hair, and the little bonnet was complete."Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious.

Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him.

Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "Now, Pris, tell me how I look," cried Kitty, as she swept into theroom late that afternoon in full gala costume.It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me.

He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog It would have been impossible for the primmest, the sourest, or themost sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a prettysight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, wereall ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and ahappy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect youngfigure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; thebright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forgetits size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of theugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set"divinely," the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be,and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kittythe blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself."Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jackwon't be ashamed of me. I really owe it to him to look my best, youknow, and that's why I'm so particular," said Kitty, in an apologetictone, as she began to lay away her finery."I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present.

Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary. Don't forgetto finish running up the facing; I've basted it carefully, and woulddo it if my head didn't ache so, I really can't hold it up anylonger," answered Pris, who had worked like a disinterested bee, whileKitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly."Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning.

And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "Go and lie down, you dear, kind soul, and don't think of my nonsenseagain," said Kitty, feeling remorseful, till Pris was comfortablyasleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery tillbedtime. So absorbed was she in learning to manage her traingracefully, that she forgot the facing till very late. Then, beingworn out with work and worry, she did, what girls are too apt to do,stuck a pin here and there, and, trusting to Priscilla's carefulbastings, left it as it was, retiring to dream of a certain HoraceFletcher, whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression uponher during the few evenings she had seen him.Nothing could have been lovelier than the morning, and few heartshappier than Kitty's, as she arrayed herself with the utmost care, andwaited in solemn state for the carriage; for muslin trains and dewyroads were incompatible, and one luxury brought another."My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil.

He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "My goodness, where did she get that stylish suit?" whispered MissSmith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated into the station with all sailset, finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonishcertain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubshad rankled, and were now avenged."I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion.

That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher?

"I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "I looked everywhere for a muslin for to-day and couldn't find any Iliked, so I was forced to wear my mauve silk," observed Miss Smith,complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress."It's very pretty, but one ruins a silk at Class Day, you know. Ithought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate thiswarm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup.

A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one thePrincess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year," returnedKitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses fromParis, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family."Those girls" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn'ta word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned HoraceFletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a littleFreshman brother to boast of, and were not going to Lyceum Hall.As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . .

"I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honestblue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if therewas anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tinybonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himselfon being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet notover-dressed."She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and thedear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss andfeathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn thatpretty hat of hers."As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me.

Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed andmade his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's armthrough his own,--"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over.

"He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me.

I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm soglad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see allthe fun.""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a creditto you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laughover it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!" andKitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to makeher cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for beforeher skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his heartyway,--"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely.

Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.""Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within.

But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath."It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she wasrolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How littleit takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, andsomebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpledwith pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when she, sittingin state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed "those girls"walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she couldforgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation.

She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still tookan interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who werenot yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophsand Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slapson the shoulder, and hearty "How are you, old fellows," they pilotedKitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'ssatisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not seeanything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet towhom he devoted himself, "because she was a stranger," Kitty said.Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight andscramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and thepoem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professorsyawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Thenthe closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest.

But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned.They don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; theycan enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, withstout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharpelbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them.They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust,and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, smallavalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, andsandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. Theyknow that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain fromthinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maximwhich bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.Kitty did have "a rousing good time;" for Jack was devoted, takingher everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her,and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcibleexpressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky trainwe will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading onflowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else hadnot been hovering about "The Daisy," as Fletcher called her.After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in herlife, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are asnatural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play,and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears.

But,excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact thefashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part.Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan,gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked collegeslang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and wasnever in the way unless she wanted him.

He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his facegrew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, andbreathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, whodanced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, butKitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh,blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments andadmiring glances."If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for," thoughtJack, beginning to lose patience. "She doesn't look like my littleKitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her asusual. I know one thing, my daughters shall never be seen knockingabout in that style."As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck.

"My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air ofpaternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about tobegin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off torest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I adviseyou to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet aturn."Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck.

Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder withsuch an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much likea top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. Asshe came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air,she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for aparty of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this Paradise castinglonging glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that allmight see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in herwake, and was just thinking to herself, "Those girls won't get overthis very soon, I fancy," when all in one moment she heard Fletcherexclaim, wrathfully, "Hang the flounces!" she saw a very glossy blackhat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and,to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with mostundignified haste.It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there wasFletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslinloop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yetperfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and MissSmith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed hermortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. Itwas only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her,and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenanceand an abrupt bow.If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then andthere, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her.For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train,set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her indead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation.

There he locked the door, andbegan to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kittycried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrousside of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically.With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminineailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher overher, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'mdisgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!""I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; youlook as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;" and Jack laughedin spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, fordust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears.

And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . .

The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see."

All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason.

It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face,she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyesdispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up themiddle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down."Never mind, you can wash them," said Jack, soothingly."I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,"groaned Kitty."Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands," cried Jack, trying to keepsober."No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more,for my head aches now so I can hardly see." And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make.

"I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason.

It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress.

He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . .

And Kitty threw off herbonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing!

He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the oldsofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got thegood landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to complyshe glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed,tragically,--"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all themischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have rippedto-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it,I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone offin a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him," cried Jack. "He isa contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape hegot you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he has gothandsome eyes and hands, and he does dance like an angel," sighedKitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had broughtdestruction to her little castle in the air."Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present.

If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Waittill you can do better, Kit."With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, toreturn presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old ladyto help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purringsand pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry."I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree whenyou've had a bit of a rest," said Jack, vibrating between door andsofa as if it wasn't easy to get away."Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more.

Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason. If the band had played  "Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life  As love's young dream--"it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience toa T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with largefamilies, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things socharming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches,quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering allabout them.Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing herfor the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making upfor lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog "Oh, I couldn't," cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea ofmeeting any one. "I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay heretill my train goes.""I thought it had gone, already," said Jack, with an irrepressibletwinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping thefloor."How can you joke about it!" and the girl's reproachful eyes filledwith tears of shame. "I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've hadmy punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise meis worse than all the rest."She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her.

I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide thetrembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone,and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But,remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking outof the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out ofthe room."I've lost them both by this day's folly," thought Kitty, as Mrs.Brown departed with the teacup. "I don't care for Fletcher, for I daresay he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because heis rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack,for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to meto-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have beenashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said aword and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris!then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will,again?"Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and thenproceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. Shesmoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up herpretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherishedbonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished itwith a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige ofthe now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in theQuakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening.Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in thetone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's betterthan being a peacock."Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with asigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves inone hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other."How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing thanoceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason.

It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough.

You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much" criedKitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture."And you know what I like," returned Jack, with an approving glance atthe altered figure before him."I'll never do so any more," murmured Kitty, wondering why she feltbashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack."Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: yourtrain doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all thattime," said Jack, offering his second gift."How did you know my size?" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in ahurry; for though Jack had called her "dear" for years, the littleword had a new sound to-night."I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are nogood now, are they?" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speakcarelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that thedirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at thatidentical moment."Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind goingwith such a fright," said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing peoplein her desire to get away from that room, because for the first timein her life she wasn't at ease with Jack."I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find"moping" rather pleasant."You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't," said Kitty, softly, as shedrew him away.Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white gloveresting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamedaway into the summer twilight.Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemedsuddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy oldhouses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to thecontrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysianfields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, thoughthey found themselves "Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing."For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, thegreatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason.

It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get meready I hate to have my things made fun of.""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time," saidJack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcherby and by."Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things aboutyour dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them just to show thatnoodle that I prefer nature to art;" and Jack gallantly stuck thefaded posy in his button-hole, while Kitty treasured up the hint sokindly given for future use.If a clock with great want of tact hadn't insisted on telling themthat it was getting late, Kitty never would have got home, for boththe young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through thesweet summer night forever.Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immenselysurprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . . Read the next short story; Lost in a London Fog Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting therealone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcherwould come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her;yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest itshould be the victim of the fatal facing.

In the sharp twinge ofjealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him,and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered howmuch he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, halfbitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jackwould never be "only cousin Jack" any more. All the vanity, coquetry,selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinoussins, for now her only thought was, "seeing these faults, he can'tcare for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"She did not say "for his sake," but in the new humility, the ardentwish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how trueher love was, and might have said with Portia,--  "For myself alone, I would not be  Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,  I would be trebled twenty times myself;  A thousand times more fair,  Ten thousand times more rich."All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms,enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of theseason.

It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke toKitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, andclung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. Shehoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the treenear which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubleditself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted suchfiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible.Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head."Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about onething,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't affordany others.

He wanted to gohome with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman havingbeen engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfactionin a travelling trio; so he gave it up. He was very silent as theywalked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kittythought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meeklyaccepted her fate. But as the train approached, she gave his hand animpulsive squeeze, and said very gratefully,--"Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly littlecousin; but I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it inany way, I will with all my heart."Jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness,humility, and pain, yet very sweet, with that new shyness in theloving eyes, and, stooping suddenly, he kissed it, whispering in atone that made the girl's heart flutter,--"I'll tell you how you may return it 'with all your heart,' by and by.Good-night, my Kitty.""Have you had a good time, dear?" asked Pris, as her sister appearedan hour later."Don't I look as if I had?" and, throwing off her wraps, Kittyrevolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of thewreck. "My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectlylimp and flat, and my gloves are ruined; I've broken Lizzie's parasol,made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper; yet myClass Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world,and I'm very, very happy!"Pris looked at her a minute, then opened her arms without a word, andKitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy.When Miss Smith and Miss Jones called a few days after to tell herthat Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures wereentirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakablesituation. He blandly wished Horace "bon voyage," and regretted thathe wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herselfto blushing beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisymuslin skirt, "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesit, and so do I," she said, with a demure look at her lover, wholaughed as if that was the best joke of the season.Kitty's Class Day was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Thu, Apr 16, 20156.8 Add  Kitty's Class Day to your library.Return to the Louisa May Alcott library, or . . .
