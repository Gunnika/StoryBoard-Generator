A Lion and an Ass agreed to go hunting together. In their searchfor game the hunters saw a number of Wild Goats run into a cave,and laid plans to catch them. The Ass was to go into the cave anddrive the Goats out, while the Lion would stand at the entranceto strike them down. The plan worked beautifully. The Ass made such a frightful din inthe cave, kicking and braying with all his might, that the Goatscame running out in a panic of fear, only to fall victim to theLion. The Ass came proudly out of the cave. "Did you see how I made them run?" he said. "Yes, indeed," answered the Lion, "and if I had not known you andyour kind I should certainly have run, too." The loud-mouthed boaster does not impress nor frighten those whoknow him. 9.6 Add  The Lion And The Ass (2nd Fable) to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
