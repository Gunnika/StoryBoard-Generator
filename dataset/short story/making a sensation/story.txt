"Do you intend going to Mrs. Walshingham's party, next week,Caroline?" asked Miss Melvina Fenton of her friend Caroline Gay. "Itis said that it will be a splendid affair.""I have not made up my mind, Melvina.""O you'll go of course. I wouldn't miss it for the world.""I am much inclined to think that I will stay at home or spend myevening in some less brilliant assemblage," Caroline Gay replied ina quiet tone."Nonsense, Caroline! There hasn't been such a chance to make asensation this season.""And why should I wish to make a sensation, Melvina?""Because it's the only way to attract attention. Now-a-days, theperson who creates a sensation, secures the prize that a dozenquiet, retiring individuals are looking and longing after, in vain.We must dazzle if we would win.""That is, we must put on false colors, and deceive not onlyourselves, but others.""How strangely you talk, Caroline! Every one now is attracted byshow and eclat.""Not every one, I hope, Melvina.""Show me an exception."Caroline smiled as she answered,"Your friend Caroline, as you call her, I hope is one.""Indeed! And I suppose I must believe you. But come, don't turnPuritan. You are almost behind the age, as it is, and if you don'ttake care, you will get clear out of date, and either live and diean old maid, or have to put up with one of your quiet inoffensivegentlemen who hardly dare look a real briliant belle in the face."Caroline Gay could not help smiling at her friend's light bantering,even while she felt inclined to be serious in consideration of thefalse views of life that were influencing the conduct and affectingthe future prospects of one, whose many good qualities of heart, wonher love."And if I should get off," she said, "with one of those quietgentlemen you allude to, it will be about the height of myexpectation.""Well, you are a queer kind of a girl, any how! But, do you know whyI want to make a sensation at Mrs. Walshingham's?""No. I would be pleased to hear.""Then I will just let you into a bit of a secret. I've set my hearton making a conquest of Henry Clarence.""Indeed!" ejaculated Caroline, with an emphasis that would haveattracted Melvina's attention, had her thoughts and feelings notbeen at the moment too much engaged."Yes, I have. He's so calm and cold, and rigidly polite to mewhenever we meet, that I am chilled with the frigid temperature ofthe atmosphere that surrounds him. But as he is a prize worth thetrouble of winning, I have set my heart on melting him down, andbringing him to my feet."Caroline smiled as her friend paused, but did not reply."I know half a dozen girls now, who are breaking their hearts afterhim," continued the maiden. "But I'll disappoint them all, if thereis power in a woman's winning ways to conquer. So you see, my ladyGay--Grave it should be--that I have some of the strongest reasonsin the world, for wishing to be present at the 'come off' next week.Now you'll go, won't you?""Perhaps I will, if it's only to see the effect of yourdemonstrations on the heart of Henry Clarence. But he is one of yourquiet, inoffensive gentlemen, Melvina. How comes it that you set himas a prize?""If he is quiet, there is fire in him. I've seen his eye flash, andhis countenance brighten with thought too often, not to know of whatkind of stuff he is made.""And if I were to judge of his character, he is not one to be caugntby effect," Caroline remarked."O, as to that, all men have their weak side. There isn't one, trustme, who can withstand the brilliant attractions of the belle of theball room, such as, pardon my vanity, I hope to be on next Tuesdayevening. I have seen a little of the world in my time, and havealways observed, that whoever can eclipse all her fair compeers atone of these brilliant assemblages, possesses, for the time, a powerthat may be used to advantage. All the beaux flock around her, andvie with each other in kind attentions. If, then, she distinguishsome individual of them above the rest, by her marked reciprocationof his attentions, he is won. The grateful fellow will never forsakeher.""Quite a reasoner, upon my word! And so in this way you intendwinning Henry Clarence?""Of course I do. At least, I shall try hard.""And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "I have not made up my mind, Melvina.""O you'll go of course. I wouldn't miss it for the world.""I am much inclined to think that I will stay at home or spend myevening in some less brilliant assemblage," Caroline Gay replied ina quiet tone."Nonsense, Caroline! There hasn't been such a chance to make asensation this season.""And why should I wish to make a sensation, Melvina?""Because it's the only way to attract attention. Now-a-days, theperson who creates a sensation, secures the prize that a dozenquiet, retiring individuals are looking and longing after, in vain.We must dazzle if we would win.""That is, we must put on false colors, and deceive not onlyourselves, but others.""How strangely you talk, Caroline! Every one now is attracted byshow and eclat.""Not every one, I hope, Melvina.""Show me an exception."Caroline smiled as she answered,"Your friend Caroline, as you call her, I hope is one.""Indeed! And I suppose I must believe you. But come, don't turnPuritan. You are almost behind the age, as it is, and if you don'ttake care, you will get clear out of date, and either live and diean old maid, or have to put up with one of your quiet inoffensivegentlemen who hardly dare look a real briliant belle in the face."Caroline Gay could not help smiling at her friend's light bantering,even while she felt inclined to be serious in consideration of thefalse views of life that were influencing the conduct and affectingthe future prospects of one, whose many good qualities of heart, wonher love."And if I should get off," she said, "with one of those quietgentlemen you allude to, it will be about the height of myexpectation.""Well, you are a queer kind of a girl, any how! But, do you know whyI want to make a sensation at Mrs. Walshingham's?""No. I would be pleased to hear.""Then I will just let you into a bit of a secret. I've set my hearton making a conquest of Henry Clarence.""Indeed!" ejaculated Caroline, with an emphasis that would haveattracted Melvina's attention, had her thoughts and feelings notbeen at the moment too much engaged."Yes, I have. He's so calm and cold, and rigidly polite to mewhenever we meet, that I am chilled with the frigid temperature ofthe atmosphere that surrounds him. But as he is a prize worth thetrouble of winning, I have set my heart on melting him down, andbringing him to my feet."Caroline smiled as her friend paused, but did not reply."I know half a dozen girls now, who are breaking their hearts afterhim," continued the maiden. "But I'll disappoint them all, if thereis power in a woman's winning ways to conquer. So you see, my ladyGay--Grave it should be--that I have some of the strongest reasonsin the world, for wishing to be present at the 'come off' next week.Now you'll go, won't you?""Perhaps I will, if it's only to see the effect of yourdemonstrations on the heart of Henry Clarence. But he is one of yourquiet, inoffensive gentlemen, Melvina. How comes it that you set himas a prize?""If he is quiet, there is fire in him. I've seen his eye flash, andhis countenance brighten with thought too often, not to know of whatkind of stuff he is made.""And if I were to judge of his character, he is not one to be caugntby effect," Caroline remarked."O, as to that, all men have their weak side. There isn't one, trustme, who can withstand the brilliant attractions of the belle of theball room, such as, pardon my vanity, I hope to be on next Tuesdayevening. I have seen a little of the world in my time, and havealways observed, that whoever can eclipse all her fair compeers atone of these brilliant assemblages, possesses, for the time, a powerthat may be used to advantage. All the beaux flock around her, andvie with each other in kind attentions. If, then, she distinguishsome individual of them above the rest, by her marked reciprocationof his attentions, he is won. The grateful fellow will never forsakeher.""Quite a reasoner, upon my word! And so in this way you intendwinning Henry Clarence?""Of course I do. At least, I shall try hard.""And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "O you'll go of course. I wouldn't miss it for the world.""I am much inclined to think that I will stay at home or spend myevening in some less brilliant assemblage," Caroline Gay replied ina quiet tone."Nonsense, Caroline! There hasn't been such a chance to make asensation this season.""And why should I wish to make a sensation, Melvina?""Because it's the only way to attract attention. Now-a-days, theperson who creates a sensation, secures the prize that a dozenquiet, retiring individuals are looking and longing after, in vain.We must dazzle if we would win.""That is, we must put on false colors, and deceive not onlyourselves, but others.""How strangely you talk, Caroline! Every one now is attracted byshow and eclat.""Not every one, I hope, Melvina.""Show me an exception."Caroline smiled as she answered,"Your friend Caroline, as you call her, I hope is one.""Indeed! And I suppose I must believe you. But come, don't turnPuritan. You are almost behind the age, as it is, and if you don'ttake care, you will get clear out of date, and either live and diean old maid, or have to put up with one of your quiet inoffensivegentlemen who hardly dare look a real briliant belle in the face."Caroline Gay could not help smiling at her friend's light bantering,even while she felt inclined to be serious in consideration of thefalse views of life that were influencing the conduct and affectingthe future prospects of one, whose many good qualities of heart, wonher love."And if I should get off," she said, "with one of those quietgentlemen you allude to, it will be about the height of myexpectation.""Well, you are a queer kind of a girl, any how! But, do you know whyI want to make a sensation at Mrs. Walshingham's?""No. I would be pleased to hear.""Then I will just let you into a bit of a secret. I've set my hearton making a conquest of Henry Clarence.""Indeed!" ejaculated Caroline, with an emphasis that would haveattracted Melvina's attention, had her thoughts and feelings notbeen at the moment too much engaged."Yes, I have. He's so calm and cold, and rigidly polite to mewhenever we meet, that I am chilled with the frigid temperature ofthe atmosphere that surrounds him. But as he is a prize worth thetrouble of winning, I have set my heart on melting him down, andbringing him to my feet."Caroline smiled as her friend paused, but did not reply."I know half a dozen girls now, who are breaking their hearts afterhim," continued the maiden. "But I'll disappoint them all, if thereis power in a woman's winning ways to conquer. So you see, my ladyGay--Grave it should be--that I have some of the strongest reasonsin the world, for wishing to be present at the 'come off' next week.Now you'll go, won't you?""Perhaps I will, if it's only to see the effect of yourdemonstrations on the heart of Henry Clarence. But he is one of yourquiet, inoffensive gentlemen, Melvina. How comes it that you set himas a prize?""If he is quiet, there is fire in him. I've seen his eye flash, andhis countenance brighten with thought too often, not to know of whatkind of stuff he is made.""And if I were to judge of his character, he is not one to be caugntby effect," Caroline remarked."O, as to that, all men have their weak side. There isn't one, trustme, who can withstand the brilliant attractions of the belle of theball room, such as, pardon my vanity, I hope to be on next Tuesdayevening. I have seen a little of the world in my time, and havealways observed, that whoever can eclipse all her fair compeers atone of these brilliant assemblages, possesses, for the time, a powerthat may be used to advantage. All the beaux flock around her, andvie with each other in kind attentions. If, then, she distinguishsome individual of them above the rest, by her marked reciprocationof his attentions, he is won. The grateful fellow will never forsakeher.""Quite a reasoner, upon my word! And so in this way you intendwinning Henry Clarence?""Of course I do. At least, I shall try hard.""And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "I am much inclined to think that I will stay at home or spend myevening in some less brilliant assemblage," Caroline Gay replied ina quiet tone."Nonsense, Caroline! There hasn't been such a chance to make asensation this season.""And why should I wish to make a sensation, Melvina?""Because it's the only way to attract attention. Now-a-days, theperson who creates a sensation, secures the prize that a dozenquiet, retiring individuals are looking and longing after, in vain.We must dazzle if we would win.""That is, we must put on false colors, and deceive not onlyourselves, but others.""How strangely you talk, Caroline! Every one now is attracted byshow and eclat.""Not every one, I hope, Melvina.""Show me an exception."Caroline smiled as she answered,"Your friend Caroline, as you call her, I hope is one.""Indeed! And I suppose I must believe you. But come, don't turnPuritan. You are almost behind the age, as it is, and if you don'ttake care, you will get clear out of date, and either live and diean old maid, or have to put up with one of your quiet inoffensivegentlemen who hardly dare look a real briliant belle in the face."Caroline Gay could not help smiling at her friend's light bantering,even while she felt inclined to be serious in consideration of thefalse views of life that were influencing the conduct and affectingthe future prospects of one, whose many good qualities of heart, wonher love."And if I should get off," she said, "with one of those quietgentlemen you allude to, it will be about the height of myexpectation.""Well, you are a queer kind of a girl, any how! But, do you know whyI want to make a sensation at Mrs. Walshingham's?""No. I would be pleased to hear.""Then I will just let you into a bit of a secret. I've set my hearton making a conquest of Henry Clarence.""Indeed!" ejaculated Caroline, with an emphasis that would haveattracted Melvina's attention, had her thoughts and feelings notbeen at the moment too much engaged."Yes, I have. He's so calm and cold, and rigidly polite to mewhenever we meet, that I am chilled with the frigid temperature ofthe atmosphere that surrounds him. But as he is a prize worth thetrouble of winning, I have set my heart on melting him down, andbringing him to my feet."Caroline smiled as her friend paused, but did not reply."I know half a dozen girls now, who are breaking their hearts afterhim," continued the maiden. "But I'll disappoint them all, if thereis power in a woman's winning ways to conquer. So you see, my ladyGay--Grave it should be--that I have some of the strongest reasonsin the world, for wishing to be present at the 'come off' next week.Now you'll go, won't you?""Perhaps I will, if it's only to see the effect of yourdemonstrations on the heart of Henry Clarence. But he is one of yourquiet, inoffensive gentlemen, Melvina. How comes it that you set himas a prize?""If he is quiet, there is fire in him. I've seen his eye flash, andhis countenance brighten with thought too often, not to know of whatkind of stuff he is made.""And if I were to judge of his character, he is not one to be caugntby effect," Caroline remarked."O, as to that, all men have their weak side. There isn't one, trustme, who can withstand the brilliant attractions of the belle of theball room, such as, pardon my vanity, I hope to be on next Tuesdayevening. I have seen a little of the world in my time, and havealways observed, that whoever can eclipse all her fair compeers atone of these brilliant assemblages, possesses, for the time, a powerthat may be used to advantage. All the beaux flock around her, andvie with each other in kind attentions. If, then, she distinguishsome individual of them above the rest, by her marked reciprocationof his attentions, he is won. The grateful fellow will never forsakeher.""Quite a reasoner, upon my word! And so in this way you intendwinning Henry Clarence?""Of course I do. At least, I shall try hard.""And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Nonsense, Caroline! There hasn't been such a chance to make asensation this season.""And why should I wish to make a sensation, Melvina?""Because it's the only way to attract attention. Now-a-days, theperson who creates a sensation, secures the prize that a dozenquiet, retiring individuals are looking and longing after, in vain.We must dazzle if we would win.""That is, we must put on false colors, and deceive not onlyourselves, but others.""How strangely you talk, Caroline! Every one now is attracted byshow and eclat.""Not every one, I hope, Melvina.""Show me an exception."Caroline smiled as she answered,"Your friend Caroline, as you call her, I hope is one.""Indeed! And I suppose I must believe you. But come, don't turnPuritan. You are almost behind the age, as it is, and if you don'ttake care, you will get clear out of date, and either live and diean old maid, or have to put up with one of your quiet inoffensivegentlemen who hardly dare look a real briliant belle in the face."Caroline Gay could not help smiling at her friend's light bantering,even while she felt inclined to be serious in consideration of thefalse views of life that were influencing the conduct and affectingthe future prospects of one, whose many good qualities of heart, wonher love."And if I should get off," she said, "with one of those quietgentlemen you allude to, it will be about the height of myexpectation.""Well, you are a queer kind of a girl, any how! But, do you know whyI want to make a sensation at Mrs. Walshingham's?""No. I would be pleased to hear.""Then I will just let you into a bit of a secret. I've set my hearton making a conquest of Henry Clarence.""Indeed!" ejaculated Caroline, with an emphasis that would haveattracted Melvina's attention, had her thoughts and feelings notbeen at the moment too much engaged."Yes, I have. He's so calm and cold, and rigidly polite to mewhenever we meet, that I am chilled with the frigid temperature ofthe atmosphere that surrounds him. But as he is a prize worth thetrouble of winning, I have set my heart on melting him down, andbringing him to my feet."Caroline smiled as her friend paused, but did not reply."I know half a dozen girls now, who are breaking their hearts afterhim," continued the maiden. "But I'll disappoint them all, if thereis power in a woman's winning ways to conquer. So you see, my ladyGay--Grave it should be--that I have some of the strongest reasonsin the world, for wishing to be present at the 'come off' next week.Now you'll go, won't you?""Perhaps I will, if it's only to see the effect of yourdemonstrations on the heart of Henry Clarence. But he is one of yourquiet, inoffensive gentlemen, Melvina. How comes it that you set himas a prize?""If he is quiet, there is fire in him. I've seen his eye flash, andhis countenance brighten with thought too often, not to know of whatkind of stuff he is made.""And if I were to judge of his character, he is not one to be caugntby effect," Caroline remarked."O, as to that, all men have their weak side. There isn't one, trustme, who can withstand the brilliant attractions of the belle of theball room, such as, pardon my vanity, I hope to be on next Tuesdayevening. I have seen a little of the world in my time, and havealways observed, that whoever can eclipse all her fair compeers atone of these brilliant assemblages, possesses, for the time, a powerthat may be used to advantage. All the beaux flock around her, andvie with each other in kind attentions. If, then, she distinguishsome individual of them above the rest, by her marked reciprocationof his attentions, he is won. The grateful fellow will never forsakeher.""Quite a reasoner, upon my word! And so in this way you intendwinning Henry Clarence?""Of course I do. At least, I shall try hard.""And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "And why should I wish to make a sensation, Melvina?""Because it's the only way to attract attention. Now-a-days, theperson who creates a sensation, secures the prize that a dozenquiet, retiring individuals are looking and longing after, in vain.We must dazzle if we would win.""That is, we must put on false colors, and deceive not onlyourselves, but others.""How strangely you talk, Caroline! Every one now is attracted byshow and eclat.""Not every one, I hope, Melvina.""Show me an exception."Caroline smiled as she answered,"Your friend Caroline, as you call her, I hope is one.""Indeed! And I suppose I must believe you. But come, don't turnPuritan. You are almost behind the age, as it is, and if you don'ttake care, you will get clear out of date, and either live and diean old maid, or have to put up with one of your quiet inoffensivegentlemen who hardly dare look a real briliant belle in the face."Caroline Gay could not help smiling at her friend's light bantering,even while she felt inclined to be serious in consideration of thefalse views of life that were influencing the conduct and affectingthe future prospects of one, whose many good qualities of heart, wonher love."And if I should get off," she said, "with one of those quietgentlemen you allude to, it will be about the height of myexpectation.""Well, you are a queer kind of a girl, any how! But, do you know whyI want to make a sensation at Mrs. Walshingham's?""No. I would be pleased to hear.""Then I will just let you into a bit of a secret. I've set my hearton making a conquest of Henry Clarence.""Indeed!" ejaculated Caroline, with an emphasis that would haveattracted Melvina's attention, had her thoughts and feelings notbeen at the moment too much engaged."Yes, I have. He's so calm and cold, and rigidly polite to mewhenever we meet, that I am chilled with the frigid temperature ofthe atmosphere that surrounds him. But as he is a prize worth thetrouble of winning, I have set my heart on melting him down, andbringing him to my feet."Caroline smiled as her friend paused, but did not reply."I know half a dozen girls now, who are breaking their hearts afterhim," continued the maiden. "But I'll disappoint them all, if thereis power in a woman's winning ways to conquer. So you see, my ladyGay--Grave it should be--that I have some of the strongest reasonsin the world, for wishing to be present at the 'come off' next week.Now you'll go, won't you?""Perhaps I will, if it's only to see the effect of yourdemonstrations on the heart of Henry Clarence. But he is one of yourquiet, inoffensive gentlemen, Melvina. How comes it that you set himas a prize?""If he is quiet, there is fire in him. I've seen his eye flash, andhis countenance brighten with thought too often, not to know of whatkind of stuff he is made.""And if I were to judge of his character, he is not one to be caugntby effect," Caroline remarked."O, as to that, all men have their weak side. There isn't one, trustme, who can withstand the brilliant attractions of the belle of theball room, such as, pardon my vanity, I hope to be on next Tuesdayevening. I have seen a little of the world in my time, and havealways observed, that whoever can eclipse all her fair compeers atone of these brilliant assemblages, possesses, for the time, a powerthat may be used to advantage. All the beaux flock around her, andvie with each other in kind attentions. If, then, she distinguishsome individual of them above the rest, by her marked reciprocationof his attentions, he is won. The grateful fellow will never forsakeher.""Quite a reasoner, upon my word! And so in this way you intendwinning Henry Clarence?""Of course I do. At least, I shall try hard.""And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Because it's the only way to attract attention. Now-a-days, theperson who creates a sensation, secures the prize that a dozenquiet, retiring individuals are looking and longing after, in vain.We must dazzle if we would win.""That is, we must put on false colors, and deceive not onlyourselves, but others.""How strangely you talk, Caroline! Every one now is attracted byshow and eclat.""Not every one, I hope, Melvina.""Show me an exception."Caroline smiled as she answered,"Your friend Caroline, as you call her, I hope is one.""Indeed! And I suppose I must believe you. But come, don't turnPuritan. You are almost behind the age, as it is, and if you don'ttake care, you will get clear out of date, and either live and diean old maid, or have to put up with one of your quiet inoffensivegentlemen who hardly dare look a real briliant belle in the face."Caroline Gay could not help smiling at her friend's light bantering,even while she felt inclined to be serious in consideration of thefalse views of life that were influencing the conduct and affectingthe future prospects of one, whose many good qualities of heart, wonher love."And if I should get off," she said, "with one of those quietgentlemen you allude to, it will be about the height of myexpectation.""Well, you are a queer kind of a girl, any how! But, do you know whyI want to make a sensation at Mrs. Walshingham's?""No. I would be pleased to hear.""Then I will just let you into a bit of a secret. I've set my hearton making a conquest of Henry Clarence.""Indeed!" ejaculated Caroline, with an emphasis that would haveattracted Melvina's attention, had her thoughts and feelings notbeen at the moment too much engaged."Yes, I have. He's so calm and cold, and rigidly polite to mewhenever we meet, that I am chilled with the frigid temperature ofthe atmosphere that surrounds him. But as he is a prize worth thetrouble of winning, I have set my heart on melting him down, andbringing him to my feet."Caroline smiled as her friend paused, but did not reply."I know half a dozen girls now, who are breaking their hearts afterhim," continued the maiden. "But I'll disappoint them all, if thereis power in a woman's winning ways to conquer. So you see, my ladyGay--Grave it should be--that I have some of the strongest reasonsin the world, for wishing to be present at the 'come off' next week.Now you'll go, won't you?""Perhaps I will, if it's only to see the effect of yourdemonstrations on the heart of Henry Clarence. But he is one of yourquiet, inoffensive gentlemen, Melvina. How comes it that you set himas a prize?""If he is quiet, there is fire in him. I've seen his eye flash, andhis countenance brighten with thought too often, not to know of whatkind of stuff he is made.""And if I were to judge of his character, he is not one to be caugntby effect," Caroline remarked."O, as to that, all men have their weak side. There isn't one, trustme, who can withstand the brilliant attractions of the belle of theball room, such as, pardon my vanity, I hope to be on next Tuesdayevening. I have seen a little of the world in my time, and havealways observed, that whoever can eclipse all her fair compeers atone of these brilliant assemblages, possesses, for the time, a powerthat may be used to advantage. All the beaux flock around her, andvie with each other in kind attentions. If, then, she distinguishsome individual of them above the rest, by her marked reciprocationof his attentions, he is won. The grateful fellow will never forsakeher.""Quite a reasoner, upon my word! And so in this way you intendwinning Henry Clarence?""Of course I do. At least, I shall try hard.""And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S.

You are almost behind the age, as it is, and if you don'ttake care, you will get clear out of date, and either live and diean old maid, or have to put up with one of your quiet inoffensivegentlemen who hardly dare look a real briliant belle in the face."Caroline Gay could not help smiling at her friend's light bantering,even while she felt inclined to be serious in consideration of thefalse views of life that were influencing the conduct and affectingthe future prospects of one, whose many good qualities of heart, wonher love."And if I should get off," she said, "with one of those quietgentlemen you allude to, it will be about the height of myexpectation.""Well, you are a queer kind of a girl, any how! But, do you know whyI want to make a sensation at Mrs. Walshingham's?""No. I would be pleased to hear.""Then I will just let you into a bit of a secret. I've set my hearton making a conquest of Henry Clarence.""Indeed!" ejaculated Caroline, with an emphasis that would haveattracted Melvina's attention, had her thoughts and feelings notbeen at the moment too much engaged."Yes, I have. He's so calm and cold, and rigidly polite to mewhenever we meet, that I am chilled with the frigid temperature ofthe atmosphere that surrounds him. But as he is a prize worth thetrouble of winning, I have set my heart on melting him down, andbringing him to my feet."Caroline smiled as her friend paused, but did not reply."I know half a dozen girls now, who are breaking their hearts afterhim," continued the maiden. "But I'll disappoint them all, if thereis power in a woman's winning ways to conquer. So you see, my ladyGay--Grave it should be--that I have some of the strongest reasonsin the world, for wishing to be present at the 'come off' next week.Now you'll go, won't you?""Perhaps I will, if it's only to see the effect of yourdemonstrations on the heart of Henry Clarence. But he is one of yourquiet, inoffensive gentlemen, Melvina. How comes it that you set himas a prize?""If he is quiet, there is fire in him. I've seen his eye flash, andhis countenance brighten with thought too often, not to know of whatkind of stuff he is made.""And if I were to judge of his character, he is not one to be caugntby effect," Caroline remarked."O, as to that, all men have their weak side. There isn't one, trustme, who can withstand the brilliant attractions of the belle of theball room, such as, pardon my vanity, I hope to be on next Tuesdayevening. I have seen a little of the world in my time, and havealways observed, that whoever can eclipse all her fair compeers atone of these brilliant assemblages, possesses, for the time, a powerthat may be used to advantage. All the beaux flock around her, andvie with each other in kind attentions. If, then, she distinguishsome individual of them above the rest, by her marked reciprocationof his attentions, he is won. The grateful fellow will never forsakeher.""Quite a reasoner, upon my word! And so in this way you intendwinning Henry Clarence?""Of course I do. At least, I shall try hard.""And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "How strangely you talk, Caroline! Every one now is attracted byshow and eclat.""Not every one, I hope, Melvina.""Show me an exception."Caroline smiled as she answered,"Your friend Caroline, as you call her, I hope is one.""Indeed! And I suppose I must believe you. But come, don't turnPuritan. You are almost behind the age, as it is, and if you don'ttake care, you will get clear out of date, and either live and diean old maid, or have to put up with one of your quiet inoffensivegentlemen who hardly dare look a real briliant belle in the face."Caroline Gay could not help smiling at her friend's light bantering,even while she felt inclined to be serious in consideration of thefalse views of life that were influencing the conduct and affectingthe future prospects of one, whose many good qualities of heart, wonher love."And if I should get off," she said, "with one of those quietgentlemen you allude to, it will be about the height of myexpectation.""Well, you are a queer kind of a girl, any how! But, do you know whyI want to make a sensation at Mrs. Walshingham's?""No. I would be pleased to hear.""Then I will just let you into a bit of a secret. I've set my hearton making a conquest of Henry Clarence.""Indeed!" ejaculated Caroline, with an emphasis that would haveattracted Melvina's attention, had her thoughts and feelings notbeen at the moment too much engaged."Yes, I have. He's so calm and cold, and rigidly polite to mewhenever we meet, that I am chilled with the frigid temperature ofthe atmosphere that surrounds him. But as he is a prize worth thetrouble of winning, I have set my heart on melting him down, andbringing him to my feet."Caroline smiled as her friend paused, but did not reply."I know half a dozen girls now, who are breaking their hearts afterhim," continued the maiden. "But I'll disappoint them all, if thereis power in a woman's winning ways to conquer. So you see, my ladyGay--Grave it should be--that I have some of the strongest reasonsin the world, for wishing to be present at the 'come off' next week.Now you'll go, won't you?""Perhaps I will, if it's only to see the effect of yourdemonstrations on the heart of Henry Clarence. But he is one of yourquiet, inoffensive gentlemen, Melvina. How comes it that you set himas a prize?""If he is quiet, there is fire in him. I've seen his eye flash, andhis countenance brighten with thought too often, not to know of whatkind of stuff he is made.""And if I were to judge of his character, he is not one to be caugntby effect," Caroline remarked."O, as to that, all men have their weak side. There isn't one, trustme, who can withstand the brilliant attractions of the belle of theball room, such as, pardon my vanity, I hope to be on next Tuesdayevening. I have seen a little of the world in my time, and havealways observed, that whoever can eclipse all her fair compeers atone of these brilliant assemblages, possesses, for the time, a powerthat may be used to advantage. All the beaux flock around her, andvie with each other in kind attentions. If, then, she distinguishsome individual of them above the rest, by her marked reciprocationof his attentions, he is won. The grateful fellow will never forsakeher.""Quite a reasoner, upon my word! And so in this way you intendwinning Henry Clarence?""Of course I do. At least, I shall try hard.""And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Not every one, I hope, Melvina.""Show me an exception."Caroline smiled as she answered,"Your friend Caroline, as you call her, I hope is one.""Indeed! And I suppose I must believe you. But come, don't turnPuritan. You are almost behind the age, as it is, and if you don'ttake care, you will get clear out of date, and either live and diean old maid, or have to put up with one of your quiet inoffensivegentlemen who hardly dare look a real briliant belle in the face."Caroline Gay could not help smiling at her friend's light bantering,even while she felt inclined to be serious in consideration of thefalse views of life that were influencing the conduct and affectingthe future prospects of one, whose many good qualities of heart, wonher love."And if I should get off," she said, "with one of those quietgentlemen you allude to, it will be about the height of myexpectation.""Well, you are a queer kind of a girl, any how! But, do you know whyI want to make a sensation at Mrs. Walshingham's?""No. I would be pleased to hear.""Then I will just let you into a bit of a secret. I've set my hearton making a conquest of Henry Clarence.""Indeed!" ejaculated Caroline, with an emphasis that would haveattracted Melvina's attention, had her thoughts and feelings notbeen at the moment too much engaged."Yes, I have. He's so calm and cold, and rigidly polite to mewhenever we meet, that I am chilled with the frigid temperature ofthe atmosphere that surrounds him. But as he is a prize worth thetrouble of winning, I have set my heart on melting him down, andbringing him to my feet."Caroline smiled as her friend paused, but did not reply."I know half a dozen girls now, who are breaking their hearts afterhim," continued the maiden. "But I'll disappoint them all, if thereis power in a woman's winning ways to conquer. So you see, my ladyGay--Grave it should be--that I have some of the strongest reasonsin the world, for wishing to be present at the 'come off' next week.Now you'll go, won't you?""Perhaps I will, if it's only to see the effect of yourdemonstrations on the heart of Henry Clarence. But he is one of yourquiet, inoffensive gentlemen, Melvina. How comes it that you set himas a prize?""If he is quiet, there is fire in him. I've seen his eye flash, andhis countenance brighten with thought too often, not to know of whatkind of stuff he is made.""And if I were to judge of his character, he is not one to be caugntby effect," Caroline remarked."O, as to that, all men have their weak side. There isn't one, trustme, who can withstand the brilliant attractions of the belle of theball room, such as, pardon my vanity, I hope to be on next Tuesdayevening. I have seen a little of the world in my time, and havealways observed, that whoever can eclipse all her fair compeers atone of these brilliant assemblages, possesses, for the time, a powerthat may be used to advantage. All the beaux flock around her, andvie with each other in kind attentions. If, then, she distinguishsome individual of them above the rest, by her marked reciprocationof his attentions, he is won. The grateful fellow will never forsakeher.""Quite a reasoner, upon my word! And so in this way you intendwinning Henry Clarence?""Of course I do. At least, I shall try hard.""And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Show me an exception."Caroline smiled as she answered,"Your friend Caroline, as you call her, I hope is one.""Indeed! And I suppose I must believe you. But come, don't turnPuritan. You are almost behind the age, as it is, and if you don'ttake care, you will get clear out of date, and either live and diean old maid, or have to put up with one of your quiet inoffensivegentlemen who hardly dare look a real briliant belle in the face."Caroline Gay could not help smiling at her friend's light bantering,even while she felt inclined to be serious in consideration of thefalse views of life that were influencing the conduct and affectingthe future prospects of one, whose many good qualities of heart, wonher love."And if I should get off," she said, "with one of those quietgentlemen you allude to, it will be about the height of myexpectation.""Well, you are a queer kind of a girl, any how! But, do you know whyI want to make a sensation at Mrs. Walshingham's?""No. I would be pleased to hear.""Then I will just let you into a bit of a secret. I've set my hearton making a conquest of Henry Clarence.""Indeed!" ejaculated Caroline, with an emphasis that would haveattracted Melvina's attention, had her thoughts and feelings notbeen at the moment too much engaged."Yes, I have. He's so calm and cold, and rigidly polite to mewhenever we meet, that I am chilled with the frigid temperature ofthe atmosphere that surrounds him. But as he is a prize worth thetrouble of winning, I have set my heart on melting him down, andbringing him to my feet."Caroline smiled as her friend paused, but did not reply."I know half a dozen girls now, who are breaking their hearts afterhim," continued the maiden. "But I'll disappoint them all, if thereis power in a woman's winning ways to conquer. So you see, my ladyGay--Grave it should be--that I have some of the strongest reasonsin the world, for wishing to be present at the 'come off' next week.Now you'll go, won't you?""Perhaps I will, if it's only to see the effect of yourdemonstrations on the heart of Henry Clarence. But he is one of yourquiet, inoffensive gentlemen, Melvina. How comes it that you set himas a prize?""If he is quiet, there is fire in him. I've seen his eye flash, andhis countenance brighten with thought too often, not to know of whatkind of stuff he is made.""And if I were to judge of his character, he is not one to be caugntby effect," Caroline remarked."O, as to that, all men have their weak side. There isn't one, trustme, who can withstand the brilliant attractions of the belle of theball room, such as, pardon my vanity, I hope to be on next Tuesdayevening. I have seen a little of the world in my time, and havealways observed, that whoever can eclipse all her fair compeers atone of these brilliant assemblages, possesses, for the time, a powerthat may be used to advantage. All the beaux flock around her, andvie with each other in kind attentions. If, then, she distinguishsome individual of them above the rest, by her marked reciprocationof his attentions, he is won. The grateful fellow will never forsakeher.""Quite a reasoner, upon my word! And so in this way you intendwinning Henry Clarence?""Of course I do. At least, I shall try hard.""And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her.

One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home Caroline smiled as she answered,"Your friend Caroline, as you call her, I hope is one.""Indeed! And I suppose I must believe you. But come, don't turnPuritan. You are almost behind the age, as it is, and if you don'ttake care, you will get clear out of date, and either live and diean old maid, or have to put up with one of your quiet inoffensivegentlemen who hardly dare look a real briliant belle in the face."Caroline Gay could not help smiling at her friend's light bantering,even while she felt inclined to be serious in consideration of thefalse views of life that were influencing the conduct and affectingthe future prospects of one, whose many good qualities of heart, wonher love."And if I should get off," she said, "with one of those quietgentlemen you allude to, it will be about the height of myexpectation.""Well, you are a queer kind of a girl, any how! But, do you know whyI want to make a sensation at Mrs. Walshingham's?""No. I would be pleased to hear.""Then I will just let you into a bit of a secret. I've set my hearton making a conquest of Henry Clarence.""Indeed!" ejaculated Caroline, with an emphasis that would haveattracted Melvina's attention, had her thoughts and feelings notbeen at the moment too much engaged."Yes, I have. He's so calm and cold, and rigidly polite to mewhenever we meet, that I am chilled with the frigid temperature ofthe atmosphere that surrounds him. But as he is a prize worth thetrouble of winning, I have set my heart on melting him down, andbringing him to my feet."Caroline smiled as her friend paused, but did not reply."I know half a dozen girls now, who are breaking their hearts afterhim," continued the maiden. "But I'll disappoint them all, if thereis power in a woman's winning ways to conquer. So you see, my ladyGay--Grave it should be--that I have some of the strongest reasonsin the world, for wishing to be present at the 'come off' next week.Now you'll go, won't you?""Perhaps I will, if it's only to see the effect of yourdemonstrations on the heart of Henry Clarence. But he is one of yourquiet, inoffensive gentlemen, Melvina. How comes it that you set himas a prize?""If he is quiet, there is fire in him. I've seen his eye flash, andhis countenance brighten with thought too often, not to know of whatkind of stuff he is made.""And if I were to judge of his character, he is not one to be caugntby effect," Caroline remarked."O, as to that, all men have their weak side. There isn't one, trustme, who can withstand the brilliant attractions of the belle of theball room, such as, pardon my vanity, I hope to be on next Tuesdayevening. I have seen a little of the world in my time, and havealways observed, that whoever can eclipse all her fair compeers atone of these brilliant assemblages, possesses, for the time, a powerthat may be used to advantage. All the beaux flock around her, andvie with each other in kind attentions. If, then, she distinguishsome individual of them above the rest, by her marked reciprocationof his attentions, he is won. The grateful fellow will never forsakeher.""Quite a reasoner, upon my word! And so in this way you intendwinning Henry Clarence?""Of course I do. At least, I shall try hard.""And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Your friend Caroline, as you call her, I hope is one.""Indeed! And I suppose I must believe you. But come, don't turnPuritan. You are almost behind the age, as it is, and if you don'ttake care, you will get clear out of date, and either live and diean old maid, or have to put up with one of your quiet inoffensivegentlemen who hardly dare look a real briliant belle in the face."Caroline Gay could not help smiling at her friend's light bantering,even while she felt inclined to be serious in consideration of thefalse views of life that were influencing the conduct and affectingthe future prospects of one, whose many good qualities of heart, wonher love."And if I should get off," she said, "with one of those quietgentlemen you allude to, it will be about the height of myexpectation.""Well, you are a queer kind of a girl, any how! But, do you know whyI want to make a sensation at Mrs. Walshingham's?""No. I would be pleased to hear.""Then I will just let you into a bit of a secret. I've set my hearton making a conquest of Henry Clarence.""Indeed!" ejaculated Caroline, with an emphasis that would haveattracted Melvina's attention, had her thoughts and feelings notbeen at the moment too much engaged."Yes, I have. He's so calm and cold, and rigidly polite to mewhenever we meet, that I am chilled with the frigid temperature ofthe atmosphere that surrounds him. But as he is a prize worth thetrouble of winning, I have set my heart on melting him down, andbringing him to my feet."Caroline smiled as her friend paused, but did not reply."I know half a dozen girls now, who are breaking their hearts afterhim," continued the maiden. "But I'll disappoint them all, if thereis power in a woman's winning ways to conquer. So you see, my ladyGay--Grave it should be--that I have some of the strongest reasonsin the world, for wishing to be present at the 'come off' next week.Now you'll go, won't you?""Perhaps I will, if it's only to see the effect of yourdemonstrations on the heart of Henry Clarence. But he is one of yourquiet, inoffensive gentlemen, Melvina. How comes it that you set himas a prize?""If he is quiet, there is fire in him. I've seen his eye flash, andhis countenance brighten with thought too often, not to know of whatkind of stuff he is made.""And if I were to judge of his character, he is not one to be caugntby effect," Caroline remarked."O, as to that, all men have their weak side. There isn't one, trustme, who can withstand the brilliant attractions of the belle of theball room, such as, pardon my vanity, I hope to be on next Tuesdayevening. I have seen a little of the world in my time, and havealways observed, that whoever can eclipse all her fair compeers atone of these brilliant assemblages, possesses, for the time, a powerthat may be used to advantage. All the beaux flock around her, andvie with each other in kind attentions. If, then, she distinguishsome individual of them above the rest, by her marked reciprocationof his attentions, he is won. The grateful fellow will never forsakeher.""Quite a reasoner, upon my word! And so in this way you intendwinning Henry Clarence?""Of course I do. At least, I shall try hard.""And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Indeed! And I suppose I must believe you. But come, don't turnPuritan. You are almost behind the age, as it is, and if you don'ttake care, you will get clear out of date, and either live and diean old maid, or have to put up with one of your quiet inoffensivegentlemen who hardly dare look a real briliant belle in the face."Caroline Gay could not help smiling at her friend's light bantering,even while she felt inclined to be serious in consideration of thefalse views of life that were influencing the conduct and affectingthe future prospects of one, whose many good qualities of heart, wonher love."And if I should get off," she said, "with one of those quietgentlemen you allude to, it will be about the height of myexpectation.""Well, you are a queer kind of a girl, any how! But, do you know whyI want to make a sensation at Mrs. Walshingham's?""No. I would be pleased to hear.""Then I will just let you into a bit of a secret. I've set my hearton making a conquest of Henry Clarence.""Indeed!" ejaculated Caroline, with an emphasis that would haveattracted Melvina's attention, had her thoughts and feelings notbeen at the moment too much engaged."Yes, I have. He's so calm and cold, and rigidly polite to mewhenever we meet, that I am chilled with the frigid temperature ofthe atmosphere that surrounds him. But as he is a prize worth thetrouble of winning, I have set my heart on melting him down, andbringing him to my feet."Caroline smiled as her friend paused, but did not reply."I know half a dozen girls now, who are breaking their hearts afterhim," continued the maiden. "But I'll disappoint them all, if thereis power in a woman's winning ways to conquer. So you see, my ladyGay--Grave it should be--that I have some of the strongest reasonsin the world, for wishing to be present at the 'come off' next week.Now you'll go, won't you?""Perhaps I will, if it's only to see the effect of yourdemonstrations on the heart of Henry Clarence. But he is one of yourquiet, inoffensive gentlemen, Melvina. How comes it that you set himas a prize?""If he is quiet, there is fire in him. I've seen his eye flash, andhis countenance brighten with thought too often, not to know of whatkind of stuff he is made.""And if I were to judge of his character, he is not one to be caugntby effect," Caroline remarked."O, as to that, all men have their weak side. There isn't one, trustme, who can withstand the brilliant attractions of the belle of theball room, such as, pardon my vanity, I hope to be on next Tuesdayevening. I have seen a little of the world in my time, and havealways observed, that whoever can eclipse all her fair compeers atone of these brilliant assemblages, possesses, for the time, a powerthat may be used to advantage. All the beaux flock around her, andvie with each other in kind attentions. If, then, she distinguishsome individual of them above the rest, by her marked reciprocationof his attentions, he is won. The grateful fellow will never forsakeher.""Quite a reasoner, upon my word! And so in this way you intendwinning Henry Clarence?""Of course I do. At least, I shall try hard.""And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S.

But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "And if I should get off," she said, "with one of those quietgentlemen you allude to, it will be about the height of myexpectation.""Well, you are a queer kind of a girl, any how! But, do you know whyI want to make a sensation at Mrs. Walshingham's?""No. I would be pleased to hear.""Then I will just let you into a bit of a secret. I've set my hearton making a conquest of Henry Clarence.""Indeed!" ejaculated Caroline, with an emphasis that would haveattracted Melvina's attention, had her thoughts and feelings notbeen at the moment too much engaged."Yes, I have. He's so calm and cold, and rigidly polite to mewhenever we meet, that I am chilled with the frigid temperature ofthe atmosphere that surrounds him. But as he is a prize worth thetrouble of winning, I have set my heart on melting him down, andbringing him to my feet."Caroline smiled as her friend paused, but did not reply."I know half a dozen girls now, who are breaking their hearts afterhim," continued the maiden. "But I'll disappoint them all, if thereis power in a woman's winning ways to conquer. So you see, my ladyGay--Grave it should be--that I have some of the strongest reasonsin the world, for wishing to be present at the 'come off' next week.Now you'll go, won't you?""Perhaps I will, if it's only to see the effect of yourdemonstrations on the heart of Henry Clarence. But he is one of yourquiet, inoffensive gentlemen, Melvina. How comes it that you set himas a prize?""If he is quiet, there is fire in him. I've seen his eye flash, andhis countenance brighten with thought too often, not to know of whatkind of stuff he is made.""And if I were to judge of his character, he is not one to be caugntby effect," Caroline remarked."O, as to that, all men have their weak side. There isn't one, trustme, who can withstand the brilliant attractions of the belle of theball room, such as, pardon my vanity, I hope to be on next Tuesdayevening. I have seen a little of the world in my time, and havealways observed, that whoever can eclipse all her fair compeers atone of these brilliant assemblages, possesses, for the time, a powerthat may be used to advantage. All the beaux flock around her, andvie with each other in kind attentions. If, then, she distinguishsome individual of them above the rest, by her marked reciprocationof his attentions, he is won. The grateful fellow will never forsakeher.""Quite a reasoner, upon my word! And so in this way you intendwinning Henry Clarence?""Of course I do. At least, I shall try hard.""And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by.

But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Well, you are a queer kind of a girl, any how! But, do you know whyI want to make a sensation at Mrs. Walshingham's?""No. I would be pleased to hear.""Then I will just let you into a bit of a secret. I've set my hearton making a conquest of Henry Clarence.""Indeed!" ejaculated Caroline, with an emphasis that would haveattracted Melvina's attention, had her thoughts and feelings notbeen at the moment too much engaged."Yes, I have. He's so calm and cold, and rigidly polite to mewhenever we meet, that I am chilled with the frigid temperature ofthe atmosphere that surrounds him. But as he is a prize worth thetrouble of winning, I have set my heart on melting him down, andbringing him to my feet."Caroline smiled as her friend paused, but did not reply."I know half a dozen girls now, who are breaking their hearts afterhim," continued the maiden. "But I'll disappoint them all, if thereis power in a woman's winning ways to conquer. So you see, my ladyGay--Grave it should be--that I have some of the strongest reasonsin the world, for wishing to be present at the 'come off' next week.Now you'll go, won't you?""Perhaps I will, if it's only to see the effect of yourdemonstrations on the heart of Henry Clarence. But he is one of yourquiet, inoffensive gentlemen, Melvina. How comes it that you set himas a prize?""If he is quiet, there is fire in him. I've seen his eye flash, andhis countenance brighten with thought too often, not to know of whatkind of stuff he is made.""And if I were to judge of his character, he is not one to be caugntby effect," Caroline remarked."O, as to that, all men have their weak side. There isn't one, trustme, who can withstand the brilliant attractions of the belle of theball room, such as, pardon my vanity, I hope to be on next Tuesdayevening. I have seen a little of the world in my time, and havealways observed, that whoever can eclipse all her fair compeers atone of these brilliant assemblages, possesses, for the time, a powerthat may be used to advantage. All the beaux flock around her, andvie with each other in kind attentions. If, then, she distinguishsome individual of them above the rest, by her marked reciprocationof his attentions, he is won. The grateful fellow will never forsakeher.""Quite a reasoner, upon my word! And so in this way you intendwinning Henry Clarence?""Of course I do. At least, I shall try hard.""And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her.

And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "No. I would be pleased to hear.""Then I will just let you into a bit of a secret. I've set my hearton making a conquest of Henry Clarence.""Indeed!" ejaculated Caroline, with an emphasis that would haveattracted Melvina's attention, had her thoughts and feelings notbeen at the moment too much engaged."Yes, I have. He's so calm and cold, and rigidly polite to mewhenever we meet, that I am chilled with the frigid temperature ofthe atmosphere that surrounds him. But as he is a prize worth thetrouble of winning, I have set my heart on melting him down, andbringing him to my feet."Caroline smiled as her friend paused, but did not reply."I know half a dozen girls now, who are breaking their hearts afterhim," continued the maiden. "But I'll disappoint them all, if thereis power in a woman's winning ways to conquer. So you see, my ladyGay--Grave it should be--that I have some of the strongest reasonsin the world, for wishing to be present at the 'come off' next week.Now you'll go, won't you?""Perhaps I will, if it's only to see the effect of yourdemonstrations on the heart of Henry Clarence. But he is one of yourquiet, inoffensive gentlemen, Melvina. How comes it that you set himas a prize?""If he is quiet, there is fire in him. I've seen his eye flash, andhis countenance brighten with thought too often, not to know of whatkind of stuff he is made.""And if I were to judge of his character, he is not one to be caugntby effect," Caroline remarked."O, as to that, all men have their weak side. There isn't one, trustme, who can withstand the brilliant attractions of the belle of theball room, such as, pardon my vanity, I hope to be on next Tuesdayevening. I have seen a little of the world in my time, and havealways observed, that whoever can eclipse all her fair compeers atone of these brilliant assemblages, possesses, for the time, a powerthat may be used to advantage. All the beaux flock around her, andvie with each other in kind attentions. If, then, she distinguishsome individual of them above the rest, by her marked reciprocationof his attentions, he is won. The grateful fellow will never forsakeher.""Quite a reasoner, upon my word! And so in this way you intendwinning Henry Clarence?""Of course I do. At least, I shall try hard.""And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room.

And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Then I will just let you into a bit of a secret. I've set my hearton making a conquest of Henry Clarence.""Indeed!" ejaculated Caroline, with an emphasis that would haveattracted Melvina's attention, had her thoughts and feelings notbeen at the moment too much engaged."Yes, I have. He's so calm and cold, and rigidly polite to mewhenever we meet, that I am chilled with the frigid temperature ofthe atmosphere that surrounds him. But as he is a prize worth thetrouble of winning, I have set my heart on melting him down, andbringing him to my feet."Caroline smiled as her friend paused, but did not reply."I know half a dozen girls now, who are breaking their hearts afterhim," continued the maiden. "But I'll disappoint them all, if thereis power in a woman's winning ways to conquer. So you see, my ladyGay--Grave it should be--that I have some of the strongest reasonsin the world, for wishing to be present at the 'come off' next week.Now you'll go, won't you?""Perhaps I will, if it's only to see the effect of yourdemonstrations on the heart of Henry Clarence. But he is one of yourquiet, inoffensive gentlemen, Melvina. How comes it that you set himas a prize?""If he is quiet, there is fire in him. I've seen his eye flash, andhis countenance brighten with thought too often, not to know of whatkind of stuff he is made.""And if I were to judge of his character, he is not one to be caugntby effect," Caroline remarked."O, as to that, all men have their weak side. There isn't one, trustme, who can withstand the brilliant attractions of the belle of theball room, such as, pardon my vanity, I hope to be on next Tuesdayevening. I have seen a little of the world in my time, and havealways observed, that whoever can eclipse all her fair compeers atone of these brilliant assemblages, possesses, for the time, a powerthat may be used to advantage. All the beaux flock around her, andvie with each other in kind attentions. If, then, she distinguishsome individual of them above the rest, by her marked reciprocationof his attentions, he is won. The grateful fellow will never forsakeher.""Quite a reasoner, upon my word! And so in this way you intendwinning Henry Clarence?""Of course I do. At least, I shall try hard.""And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline.

But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes.

Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S.

Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Yes, I have. He's so calm and cold, and rigidly polite to mewhenever we meet, that I am chilled with the frigid temperature ofthe atmosphere that surrounds him. But as he is a prize worth thetrouble of winning, I have set my heart on melting him down, andbringing him to my feet."Caroline smiled as her friend paused, but did not reply."I know half a dozen girls now, who are breaking their hearts afterhim," continued the maiden. "But I'll disappoint them all, if thereis power in a woman's winning ways to conquer. So you see, my ladyGay--Grave it should be--that I have some of the strongest reasonsin the world, for wishing to be present at the 'come off' next week.Now you'll go, won't you?""Perhaps I will, if it's only to see the effect of yourdemonstrations on the heart of Henry Clarence. But he is one of yourquiet, inoffensive gentlemen, Melvina. How comes it that you set himas a prize?""If he is quiet, there is fire in him. I've seen his eye flash, andhis countenance brighten with thought too often, not to know of whatkind of stuff he is made.""And if I were to judge of his character, he is not one to be caugntby effect," Caroline remarked."O, as to that, all men have their weak side. There isn't one, trustme, who can withstand the brilliant attractions of the belle of theball room, such as, pardon my vanity, I hope to be on next Tuesdayevening. I have seen a little of the world in my time, and havealways observed, that whoever can eclipse all her fair compeers atone of these brilliant assemblages, possesses, for the time, a powerthat may be used to advantage. All the beaux flock around her, andvie with each other in kind attentions. If, then, she distinguishsome individual of them above the rest, by her marked reciprocationof his attentions, he is won. The grateful fellow will never forsakeher.""Quite a reasoner, upon my word! And so in this way you intendwinning Henry Clarence?""Of course I do. At least, I shall try hard.""And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will.

In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home Caroline smiled as her friend paused, but did not reply."I know half a dozen girls now, who are breaking their hearts afterhim," continued the maiden. "But I'll disappoint them all, if thereis power in a woman's winning ways to conquer. So you see, my ladyGay--Grave it should be--that I have some of the strongest reasonsin the world, for wishing to be present at the 'come off' next week.Now you'll go, won't you?""Perhaps I will, if it's only to see the effect of yourdemonstrations on the heart of Henry Clarence. But he is one of yourquiet, inoffensive gentlemen, Melvina. How comes it that you set himas a prize?""If he is quiet, there is fire in him. I've seen his eye flash, andhis countenance brighten with thought too often, not to know of whatkind of stuff he is made.""And if I were to judge of his character, he is not one to be caugntby effect," Caroline remarked."O, as to that, all men have their weak side. There isn't one, trustme, who can withstand the brilliant attractions of the belle of theball room, such as, pardon my vanity, I hope to be on next Tuesdayevening. I have seen a little of the world in my time, and havealways observed, that whoever can eclipse all her fair compeers atone of these brilliant assemblages, possesses, for the time, a powerthat may be used to advantage. All the beaux flock around her, andvie with each other in kind attentions. If, then, she distinguishsome individual of them above the rest, by her marked reciprocationof his attentions, he is won. The grateful fellow will never forsakeher.""Quite a reasoner, upon my word! And so in this way you intendwinning Henry Clarence?""Of course I do. At least, I shall try hard.""And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "I know half a dozen girls now, who are breaking their hearts afterhim," continued the maiden. "But I'll disappoint them all, if thereis power in a woman's winning ways to conquer. So you see, my ladyGay--Grave it should be--that I have some of the strongest reasonsin the world, for wishing to be present at the 'come off' next week.Now you'll go, won't you?""Perhaps I will, if it's only to see the effect of yourdemonstrations on the heart of Henry Clarence. But he is one of yourquiet, inoffensive gentlemen, Melvina. How comes it that you set himas a prize?""If he is quiet, there is fire in him. I've seen his eye flash, andhis countenance brighten with thought too often, not to know of whatkind of stuff he is made.""And if I were to judge of his character, he is not one to be caugntby effect," Caroline remarked."O, as to that, all men have their weak side. There isn't one, trustme, who can withstand the brilliant attractions of the belle of theball room, such as, pardon my vanity, I hope to be on next Tuesdayevening. I have seen a little of the world in my time, and havealways observed, that whoever can eclipse all her fair compeers atone of these brilliant assemblages, possesses, for the time, a powerthat may be used to advantage. All the beaux flock around her, andvie with each other in kind attentions. If, then, she distinguishsome individual of them above the rest, by her marked reciprocationof his attentions, he is won. The grateful fellow will never forsakeher.""Quite a reasoner, upon my word! And so in this way you intendwinning Henry Clarence?""Of course I do. At least, I shall try hard.""And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room.

"I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye.

"I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice.

I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S.

But he is one of yourquiet, inoffensive gentlemen, Melvina. How comes it that you set himas a prize?""If he is quiet, there is fire in him. I've seen his eye flash, andhis countenance brighten with thought too often, not to know of whatkind of stuff he is made.""And if I were to judge of his character, he is not one to be caugntby effect," Caroline remarked."O, as to that, all men have their weak side. There isn't one, trustme, who can withstand the brilliant attractions of the belle of theball room, such as, pardon my vanity, I hope to be on next Tuesdayevening.

But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's.

I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes.

He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "And if I were to judge of his character, he is not one to be caugntby effect," Caroline remarked."O, as to that, all men have their weak side. There isn't one, trustme, who can withstand the brilliant attractions of the belle of theball room, such as, pardon my vanity, I hope to be on next Tuesdayevening. I have seen a little of the world in my time, and havealways observed, that whoever can eclipse all her fair compeers atone of these brilliant assemblages, possesses, for the time, a powerthat may be used to advantage. All the beaux flock around her, andvie with each other in kind attentions. If, then, she distinguishsome individual of them above the rest, by her marked reciprocationof his attentions, he is won. The grateful fellow will never forsakeher.""Quite a reasoner, upon my word! And so in this way you intendwinning Henry Clarence?""Of course I do. At least, I shall try hard.""And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal.

No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "O, as to that, all men have their weak side. There isn't one, trustme, who can withstand the brilliant attractions of the belle of theball room, such as, pardon my vanity, I hope to be on next Tuesdayevening. I have seen a little of the world in my time, and havealways observed, that whoever can eclipse all her fair compeers atone of these brilliant assemblages, possesses, for the time, a powerthat may be used to advantage. All the beaux flock around her, andvie with each other in kind attentions. If, then, she distinguishsome individual of them above the rest, by her marked reciprocationof his attentions, he is won. The grateful fellow will never forsakeher.""Quite a reasoner, upon my word! And so in this way you intendwinning Henry Clarence?""Of course I do. At least, I shall try hard.""And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy.

"Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room.

As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Quite a reasoner, upon my word! And so in this way you intendwinning Henry Clarence?""Of course I do. At least, I shall try hard.""And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners.

And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "And you will fail, I am much disposed to think.""I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend.

No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "I'm not sure of that. Henry Clarence is but a man.""Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like.

No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her.

If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood.

Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Yet he is too close an observer to be deceived into any strongadmiration of a ball-room belle.""You are behind the age, Caroline. Your quiet unobtrusiveness will Ifear cause you to be passed by, while some one not half so worthy,will take the place which you should have held in the affections ofa good husband.""Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power.

He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me.

Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Perhaps so. But, I wish to be taken for what I am. I want no man,who has not the good sense and discrimination to judge of my realcharacter.""You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite.

I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "You will die an old maid, Caroline.""That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room.

"I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice.

Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration.

He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me.

We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "That may be. But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not.""You will go to the ball, of course?""I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S.

Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "I think I will, Melvina.""Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like.

"I must dance with herto-night.

But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Well, that settled, what are you going to wear?""Something plain and simple, of course. But I have not thought ofthat.""O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all.

May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "O don't Caroline. You will make yourself singular.""I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume.

I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "I hope not, for I dislike singularity. But how are you going todress? Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation.""I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton.

Read the next short story; Not at Home "I'll try my best, I can assure you?""Well, what kind of a dress are you going to appear in?""I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S.

She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "I have ordered a robe of blue tulle, to be worn over blue silk. Therobe to be open in front, of course, and confined to the silk-skirtwith variegated roses.""And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy.

"I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice.

And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "And your head-dress?""I shall have my hair ornamented with variegated roses, arrangedover the brow like a coronet. Now, how do you like that?""Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me.

But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Not at all.""O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye.

As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "O, of course not. I might have known that your taste was toouneducated for that.""And I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina.""But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no.

After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "But how will you dress, Caroline. Do let me hear, that I may putyou right if you fix on any thing outre.""Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule.

"Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Well, really, Melvina, I have not given the subject a thought. Butit never takes me long to choose. Let me see. A plain--""Not plain, Caroline, for mercy sake!""Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room.

"I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice.

She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Yes. A plain white dress, of India muslin.""Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts.

"Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Plain white! O, don't Caroline--let me beg of you.""Yes, white it shall be.""Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton.

You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Plain white! Why nobody will see you!""O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so.

But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal.

Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "O, yes. Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observedof all observers," said Caroline, laughing."Don't flatter yourself. But you will have some pink trimming, willyou not?""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence.

You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel.""You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so.

I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "You will be an object of ridicule.""Not in a polite company of gentlemen and ladies, I hope!""No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress.

Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "No; but--. And your head-dress, Caroline. That I hope will atonefor the rest.""No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal.

Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "No, my own dark hair, plain--""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain.""Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room.

Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice.

"Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Yes, my hair plain.""And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading.

"Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "And no ornament!""O, yes--a very beautiful one.""Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room.

"I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice.

We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Ah, that may help a little. A ray of sunshine on a barren waste.""A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule.

"I must dance with herto-night.

And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "A simple sprig of buds and half blown flowers.""The color?""White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice.

We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "White, of course.""You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be.

None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "You are an original, Caroline. But I suppose I can't make youchange your taste?"I hope not, Melvina.""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration.

Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in theshade, my little Quakeress friend. The world will never know halfyour real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light."Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book.

Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Many a gem of purest ray serene,The deep unfathomed caves of ocean bear--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air."And as she repeated these lines, applying them to her friend,Melvina rose to depart."You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S.

He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts.

But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye.

"I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "You are resolved on trying to make a sensation, then?" saidCaroline."Of course, and what is more, I will succeed.""And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no.

Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "And win Henry Clarence?""I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action.

But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied.

But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be.

She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested.

But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood.

I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "I hope so. He must be made of sterner stuff than I think him, if Ido not.""Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all.

He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me.

Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Well, we shall see.""Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Yes, we will. But good-bye; I must go to the mantua-maker's thismorning, to complete my orders."After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home After Melvina Felton had gone, Caroline Gay's manner changed a gooddeal. Her cheek, the color of which had heightened during herconversation with her friend, still retained its beautiful glow, butthe expression of her usually calm face was changed, and slightlymarked by what seemed troubled thoughts. She sat almost motionlessfor nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh,and went to her chamber.It was early on the same evening that Henry Clarence, the subject ofher conversation with Melvina, called in, as he not unfrequentlydid, to spend an hour in pleasant conversation with Caroline Gay. Hefound her in the parlor reading."At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S.

But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway.

"Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "At your books, I see," he remarked, in a pleasant tone, as heentered."Yes; I find my thoughts need exciting by contact with the thoughtsof others. A good book helps us much sometimes.""You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room.

"I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice.

But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "You were reading a book then. May I ask its author?""Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway.

"But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy.

Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence.

And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion.

I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Degerando.""You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid.

Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S.

Read the next short story; Not at Home "You are right in calling this a good book, Caroline," he said,glancing at the title page, to which she had opened, as she handedhim the volume. "Self-education is a most important matter, and withsuch a guide as Degerando, few can go wrong.""So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading.

I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite.

We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule.

How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?"

But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested.

If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "So I think. He is not so abstract, nor does he border ontranscendentalism, like Coleridge, who notwithstanding thesepeculiarities I am yet fond of reading. Degerando opens for you yourown heart, and not only opens it, but gives you the means ofself-control at every point of your exploration."The beautiful countenance of Caroline was lit up by pure thoughts,and Henry Clarence could not help gazing upon her with a livelyfeeling of admiration."I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening.

Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "I cannot but approve your taste," he said.--"But do you not alsoread the lighter works of the day?""I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested.

I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence.

Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half.

Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all.

He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "I do not certainly pass all these by. I would lose much were I todo so. But I read only a few, and those emanating from such minds asJames, Scott, and especially our own Miss Sedgwick. The latter isparticularly my favorite. Her pictures, besides being true tonature, are pictures of home. The life she sketches, is the lifethat is passing all around us--perhaps in the family, unknown to us,who hold the relation of next door neighbors.""Your discrimination is just. After reading Miss Sedgwick, oursympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range. We aremoved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering--toregulate our own action in regard to others by a higher and betterrule. You are a reader of the poets, too--and like myself, Ibelieve, are an admirer of Wordsworth's calm and deep sympathy withthe better and nobler principles of our nature.""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S.

The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me. How much ofthe good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scatteredthickly over his pages!""And Byron and Shelly--can you not enjoy them?" Clarence asked, withsomething of lively interest in her reply, expressed in hiscountenance."It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration.

Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "It were but an affectation to say that I can find nothing in themthat is beautiful, nothing to please, nothing to admire. I have readmany things in the writings of these men that were exquisitelybeautiful. Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are notsurpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language:and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisitetenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification. But I havenever laid either of them down with feelings that I wished mightremain. They excite the mind to a feverish and unhealthy action. Wefind little in them to deepen our sympathies with ourfellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head.""You discriminate with clearness, Caroline," he said; "I did notknow that you looked so narrowly into the merits of the world'sfavorites. But to change the subject; do you intend going to Mrs.Walsingham's next week?""Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room.

I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Yes, I think I will be there.""Are you fond of such assemblages?" the young man asked."Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress.

Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Not particularly so," Caroline replied. "But I think it right tomingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant tome.""And why do you mingle in it then, if its sphere is uncongenial?""I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room.

And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "I cannot say, Mr. Clarence, that it is altogether uncongenial.Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that isgood. Beneath the false glitter, often assumed and worn without theheart's being in it, but from a weak spirit of conformity, lies muchthat is sound in principle, and healthy in moral life. In mingling,then, in society, we aid to develope and strengthen these goodprinciples in others. We encourage, often, the weak and wavering,and bring back such as are beginning to wander from the simpledignity and truth of nature.""But is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the falseglitter?""There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room.

Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "There may be. But we need not fear this, if we settle in our mindsa right principle of action, and bind ourselves firmly to thatprinciple."A pause followed this last remark, and then the subject ofconversation was again changed to one of a more general nature.An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy.

Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home An evening or two after, Henry Clarence called in to see MelvinaFenton. Melvina was what may be called a showy girl. Hercountenance, which was really beautiful, when animated, attractedevery eye. She had a constant flow of spirits, had dipped into manybooks, and could make a little knowledge in these matters go a greatway. Clarence could not conceal from himself that he admiredMelvina, and, although his good sense and discrimination opposedthis admiration, he could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton,without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, aswith every one, he maintained a consistency of character thatannoyed her. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way; andfor this she thought him cold, and often felt under restraint in hissociety. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress.Often he would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of hergood sense and information could be guilty of such a glaringdeparture from true taste.On this evening she received him in her very best manner. And shewas skilful at acting; so skilful, as even to deceive the keen eyeof Henry Clarence. Fully resolved on making a conquest, she studiedhis character, and tried to adapt herself to it."I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty.

And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "I have your favorite here," she remarked, during the evening,lifting a copy of Wordsworth from the centre table."Ah, indeed! so you have. Do you ever look into him, Miss Fenton?""O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice.

But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "O yes. I did not know what a treasure was hid in this volume,until, from hearing your admiration of Wordsworth, I procured andread it with delighted interest.""I am glad that you are not disappointed. If you have a taste forhis peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volumean inexhaustible source of pleasure.""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for thedelight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive."Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand.

She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home Nearly two hours were spent by the young man in the company of MissFenton, when he went away, more prepossessed in her favor than hehad yet been. She had played her part to admiration. The truth was,Wordsworth, except in a few pieces, she had voted a dull book. Bytasking herself, she had mastered some passages, to which shereferred during the evening, and thus obtained credit for being farmore familiar with the poet of nature than she ever was or everwould be. She went upon the principle of making a sensation, andthus carrying hearts, or the heart she wished to assault, by storm."I believe that I really love that girl," Henry Clarence said, onthe evening before the party at Mrs. Walsingham's to a young friend."Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her.

"I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "Who, Melvina Fenton?""Yes.""She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner.

Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S.

Read the next short story; Not at Home "She is certainly a beautiful girl.""And interesting and intelligent.""Yes--I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off thepalm.""And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S.

But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "And still, there is one thing about her that I do not like. She istoo fond of dress and display.""O, that is only a little foible. No one is altogether perfect.""True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room.

You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "True--and the fault with me is, in looking after perfection.""Yes, I think you expect too much.""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies.And what is more, I can see plainly enough that her heart isinterested. The brightening of her cheek, the peculiar expression ofher eye, not to be mistaken, when certain subjects are glanced at,convince me that I have only to woo to win her.""What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S.

"I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "What do you think of Caroline Gay?" asked his friend."Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her. She hasintelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject.But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling. If she were not socalm and cold, I could love her; but I do not want a stoic for awife. I want a heart that will leap to my own, and send its emotionto the cheek and eye.""I am afraid you will not find an angel in this world," his friendsaid, smiling."No, nor do I want an angel. But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice.

And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S.

But I want as perfect a woman as I canget.""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceedinggood qualities, at least, overshadowing all others.""And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence.

You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "And what are they?""Beauty.""Well?""An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope.

ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "An affectionate heart.""Something to be desired above every thing else. And her next goodquality?""Her father is worth a 'plum.'""I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power.

"I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "I would dispense with that, were she less fond of show, and effect,and gay company.""O, they are only the accompaniments of girlhood. As a woman and awife, she will lay them all aside.""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers.""Why, I thought your mind was made up.""Not positively. I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay.

"Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S.

I must look on a little longer, and scan a littlecloser before I commit myself.""Well, success to your marrying expedition. I belong yet to the freelist."In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow.

"Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home In due time Mrs. Walshingham's splendid affair came off."Isn't she an elegant woman!" exclaimed a young man in an undertone, to a friend, who stood near Henry Clarence, as Melvina sweptinto the room dressed in a style of elegance and effect thatattracted every eye."Beautiful!" responded his companion. "I must dance with herto-night. I always make a point to have one round at least with thebelle of the ball-room."The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress.

I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home The individual who last spoke, was well known to all in that room asthe betrayer of innocence. And Henry Clarence felt his cheek burnand his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark."He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken," he said to himself asthe two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part ofthe room. "But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitiveinnocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance withhim, and suffer her hand to be touched by his, my mind is made up. Iwill never marry her.""She is the queen of beauty to-night, Clarence," said a friendcoming to Henry's side, and speaking in an under tone."She is, indeed, very beautiful; but I cannot help thinking a littletoo showy. Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground.

Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S.

Her dress would be very good for the occasion were thosevariegated roses taken from their blue ground. Flowers never grow onsuch a soil; and her head dress is by far too conspicuous, and by nomeans in good taste.""Why you are critical to-night, Clarence. I thought Melvina one ofyour favorites?""I must confess a little good will towards her, and perhaps that isthe reason of my being somewhat particular in my observation of herstyle of dress. Certainly, she makes a most decided sensation hereto-night; for every eye is upon her, and every tongue, that I haveyet heard speak is teeming with words of admiration.""That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half.

As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "That she does," responded the friend. "Every other girl in the roomwill be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over.""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the goodsense of the young ladies," was the quiet reply.Several times the eye of Henry Clarence wandered around the room insearch of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage."She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice.

I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "She told me she would be here," he mentally said, "and I shouldreally like to mark the contrast between her and the brilliant MissFenton. Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm of herfather, the very personification of innocence and beauty. But herface is too calm by half. I fear she is cold."Truly was she as Henry Clarence had said, the personification ofinnocence and beauty. Her dress of snowy whiteness, made perfectlyplain, and fitting well a figure that was rather delicate, but ofexquisite symmetry, contrasted beautifully with the gay andflaunting attire of those around her. Her head could boast but asingle ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and thatwas a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress shehad chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter andmore innocent than ever, for the contrast of the whole scenerelieved her peculiar beauty admirably."An angel?" ejaculated a young man by the side of Clarence, movingover towards the part of the room where Caroline stood, stillleaning on the arm of her father."We wanted but you to make our tableau complete," he said, with agraceful bow. "Let me relieve you, Mr. Gay, of the care of thisyoung lady," he added offering his arm to Caroline--and in the nextminute he had joined the promenade with the sweetest creature in theroom by his side.The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes.

And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home The beautiful contrast that was evident to all, between Caroline,the plainest-dressed maiden in the room, and Melvina the gayest andmost imposing, soon drew all eyes upon the former, and Melvina hadthe discrimination to perceive that she had a rival near the throne,in one whom she little dreamed of fearing; and whose innocent heartshe knew too well to accuse of design.Soon cotillion parties were formed, and among the first to offer hishand to Melvina, was a young man named Sheldon, the same alluded toas declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with thebelle of the ball room. Melvina knew his character well, and HenryClarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye wasupon her, and she knew it. But she did not know of the determinationthat he formed or else she would have hesitated."The most splendid man in the room, and the most graceful dancer,"were the thoughts that glanced through her mind, as she smiled anassent to his invitation to become his partner. "I shall not yetlose my power."And now all eyes were again upon the brilliant beauty threading themazy circles, with glowing cheek and sparkling eye. And few thoughtof blaming her for dancing with Sheldon, whose character ought tohave banished him from virtuous society. But there was one whoseheart sickened as he looked on, and that one was Henry Clarence. Helingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and thenwandered away to another room."Permit me to transfer my company, Mr. Clarence," said the young manwho had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. "I willnot be selfish; and besides, I fear I am becoming too dull for myfair friend here."With a bow and a smile, Clarence received on his arm the fair girl.He felt for her a tenderer regard than had heretofore warmed hisheart, as he strolled through the rooms and listened to her sweet,penetrating voice. And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters.

And whenever he turned and looked her in theface, he saw that in the expression of her eyes which he had nevermarked before--something of tenderness that made his own heart beatwith a quicker motion. As they drew near the dancers, they observedSheldon with Melvina leaning on his arm, and two or three others,engaged in maikng up another cotillion."We want but one more couple, and here they are," said Sheldon, asClarence and Caroline came up."Will you join this set?" asked Clarence, in a low tone."Not this one," she replied."Miss Gay does not wish to dance now," her companion said, and theymoved away.But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S.

I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion. Ihad a great mind for a while never to forgive you.""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina," Caroline said, with aserious air. "I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home But the cotillion was speedily formed without them, and the danceproceeded.Half an hour after, while Henry Clarence and Caroline were sittingon a lounge, engaged in close conversation, Sheldon came up, andbowing in his most graceful manner, and, with his blandest smile,said,"Can I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Gay, this evening?""No, sir," was the quiet, firm reply of the maiden, while she lookedhim steadily in the face.Sheldon turned hurriedly away, for he understood the rebuke, thefirst he had yet met with in the refined, fashionable, virtuoussociety of one of the largest of the Atlantic cities.The heart of Henry Clarence blessed the maiden by his side."You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters.

I went but inmy true character, and exhibited no other.""It was nature, then, eclipsing art; truth of character outshiningthe glitter of false assumption. But all that is past, and I amwiser and better for it, I hope. You will be happy, I know, withHenry Clarence, for he is worthy of you, and can appreciate yourreal excellence; and I shall be happy, I trust, with the man of mychoice.""No doubt of it, Melvina. And by the way," Caroline said, laughing,"we shall make another 'sensation,' and then we must be content toretire into peaceful domestic obscurity. You will have a brillianttime, I suppose?""O yes. I must try my hand at creating one more sensation, the lastand most imposing; and, as my wedding comes the first, you must bemy bridesmaid. You will not refuse?""Not if we can agree as to how we are to dress. We ought to be alikein this, and yet I can never consent to appear in any thing but whatis plain, and beautiful for its simplicity.""You shall arrange all these. You beat me the last time in creatinga sensation, and now I will give up to your better taste."And rarely has a bride looked sweeter than did Melvina Fenton on herwedding-day. Still, she was eclipsed by Caroline, whose native graceaccorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked uponher, looked again, and to admire. The "sensation" they created wasnot soon forgotten.Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines ofour story passed from the notice of the fashionable world, and werelost with the thousands who thus yearly desert the gay circles, andenter the quiet sphere and sweet obscurity of domestic life.9.3 Add  Making a Sensation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Not at Home "You are not averse to dancing, Caroline?" he said."O no. But I do not dance with every one.""In that you are right, and I honor your decision and independenceof character."During the remainder of the evening, she danced several times, morefrequently with Henry than with any other, but never in a cotillionof which Sheldon was one of the partners. Much to the pain and alarmof Melvina, Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and longbefore the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed toproduce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping,and turned away unsatisfied. But let Caroline go where she would,she was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple andbeautiful attire; none looked upon her mild, innocent face, withoutan expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. Even the rebuked, andfor a time angered, Sheldon, could not help ever and anon seekingher out amid the crowd, and gazing upon her with a feeling ofrespect that he tried in vain to subdue.Melvina had sought to produce a "sensation" by gay and imposingattire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. ButCaroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigningbelle of the evening, consulting her own pure taste, went in simplegarments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all, and, what wasmore, the heart of Henry Clarence. He never, after that evening,could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards MelvinaFelton. The veil had fallen from his eyes. He saw the differencebetween the desire of admiration, and a simple love of truth andhonor, too plainly, to cause him to hesitate a moment longer in hischoice between two so opposite in their characters. And yet, to theeye of an inattentive observer nothing occurred during the progressof Mrs. Walshingham's party more than ordinarily takes place on suchoccasions. All seemed pleased and happy, and Melvina the happiest ofthe whole. And yet she had signally failed in her well-laid schemeto take the heart of Henry Clarence--while Caroline, with no suchdesign, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and aright taste, had won his affectionate regard.It was some three or four months after the party at Mrs.Walshingham's, that Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone inthe chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation."I have expected as much," the former said, in answer to somecommunication made to her by the latter."Then you are not surprised?""Not at all.""And I hope not pained by the intelligence?""No, Caroline, not now," her friend said, smiling; "though two orthree months ago it would have almost killed me. I, too, have beenwooed and won.""Indeed! That is news. And who is it, Melvina? I am eager to know.""Martin Colburn.""A gentleman, and every way worthy of your hand. But how in theworld comes it that so quiet and modest a young man as Martin hasnow the dashing belle?""It has occurred quite naturally, Caroline. The dashing belle hasgained a little more good sense than she had a few months ago. Shehas not forgotten the party at Mrs. Walsaingham's. And by the bye,Caroline, how completely you out-generalled me on that occasion.
