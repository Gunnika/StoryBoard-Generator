A Raven, which you know is black as coal, was envious of theSwan, because her feathers were as white as the purest snow. Thefoolish bird got the idea that if he lived like the Swan,swimming and diving all day long and eating the weeds and plantsthat grow in the water, his feathers would turn white like theSwan's. So he left his home in the woods and fields and flew down to liveon the lakes and in the marshes. But though he washed and washedall day long, almost drowning himself at it, his feathersremained as black as ever. And as the water weeds he ate did notagree with him, he got thinner and thinner, and at last he died. A change of habits will not alter nature.  7.6 Add  A Raven And A Swan to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
