A Giant Oak stood near a brook in which grew some slender Reeds.When the wind blew, the great Oak stood proudly upright with itshundred arms uplifted to the sky. But the Reeds bowed low in thewind and sang a sad and mournful song. "You have reason to complain," said the Oak. "The slightestbreeze that ruffles the surface of the water makes you bow yourheads, while I, the mighty Oak, stand upright and firm before thehowling tempest." "Do not worry about us," replied the Reeds. "The winds do notharm us. We bow before them and so we do not break. You, in allyour pride and strength, have so far resisted their blows. Butthe end is coming." As the Reeds spoke a great hurricane rushed out of the north. TheOak stood proudly and fought against the storm, while theyielding Reeds bowed low. The wind redoubled in fury, and all atonce the great tree fell, torn up by the roots, and lay among thepitying Reeds. Better to yield when it is folly to resist, than to resiststubbornly and be destroyed. 9.0 Add  The Oak And The Reeds to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
