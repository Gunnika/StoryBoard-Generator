A Fox was caught in a trap one fine morning, because he had gottoo near the Farmer's hen house. No doubt he was hungry, but thatwas not an excuse for stealing. A Cock, rising early, discoveredwhat had happened. He knew the Fox could not get at him, so hewent a little closer to get a good look at his enemy. The Fox saw a slender chance of escape. "Dear friend," he said, "I was just on my way to visit a sickrelative, when I stumbled into this string and got all tangledup. But please do not tell anybody about it. I dislike causingsorrow to anybody, and I am sure I can soon gnaw this string topieces." But the Cock was not to be so easily fooled. He soon roused thewhole hen yard, and when the Farmer came running out, that wasthe end of Mr. Fox. The wicked deserve no aid. 8.2 Add  The Cock And The Fox (2nd Fable) to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
