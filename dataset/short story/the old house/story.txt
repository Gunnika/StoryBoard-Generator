In the street, up there, was an old, a very old house--it was almost threehundred years old, for that might be known by reading the great beam on whichthe date of the year was carved: together with tulips and hop-binds there werewhole verses spelled as in former times, and over every window was a distortedface cut out in the beam. The one story stood forward a great way over theother; and directly under the eaves was a leaden spout with a dragon's head;the rain-water should have run out of the mouth, but it ran out of the belly,for there was a hole in the spout.All the other houses in the street were so new and so neat, with large windowpanes and smooth walls, one could easily see that they would have nothing todo with the old house: they certainly thought, "How long is that old decayedthing to stand here as a spectacle in the street? And then the projectingwindows stand so far out, that no one can see from our windows what happens inthat direction! The steps are as broad as those of a palace, and as high as toa church tower. The iron railings look just like the door to an old familyvault, and then they have brass tops--that's so stupid!"On the other side of the street were also new and neat houses, and theythought just as the others did; but at the window opposite the old house theresat a little boy with fresh rosy cheeks and bright beaming eyes: he certainlyliked the old house best, and that both in sunshine and moonshine. And when helooked across at the wall where the mortar had fallen out, he could sit andfind out there the strangest figures imaginable; exactly as the street hadappeared before, with steps, projecting windows, and pointed gables; he couldsee soldiers with halberds, and spouts where the water ran, like dragons andserpents. That was a house to look at; and there lived an old man, who woreplush breeches; and he had a coat with large brass buttons, and a wig that onecould see was a real wig. Every morning there came an old fellow to him whoput his rooms in order, and went on errands; otherwise, the old man in theplush breeches was quite alone in the old house. Now and then he came to thewindow and looked out, and the little boy nodded to him, and the old mannodded again, and so they became acquaintances, and then they were friends,although they had never spoken to each other--but that made no difference. Thelittle boy heard his parents say, "The old man opposite is very well off, buthe is so very, very lonely!"The Sunday following, the little boy took something, and wrapped it up in apiece of paper, went downstairs, and stood in the doorway; and when the manwho went on errands came past, he said to him--"I say, master! will you give this to the old man over the way from me? I havetwo pewter soldiers--this is one of them, and he shall have it, for I know heis so very, very lonely."And the old errand man looked quite pleased, nodded, and took the pewtersoldier over to the old house. Afterwards there came a message; it was to askif the little boy himself had not a wish to come over and pay a visit; and sohe got permission of his parents, and then went over to the old house.And the brass balls on the iron railings shone much brighter than ever; onewould have thought they were polished on account of the visit; and it was asif the carved-out trumpeters--for there were trumpeters, who stood in tulips,carved out on the door--blew with all their might, their cheeks appeared somuch rounder than before. Yes, they blew--"Trateratra! The little boy comes!Trateratra!"--and then the door opened.The whole passage was hung with portraits of knights in armor, and ladies insilken gowns; and the armor rattled, and the silken gowns rustled! And thenthere was a flight of stairs which went a good way upwards, and a little waydownwards, and then one came on a balcony which was in a very dilapidatedstate, sure enough, with large holes and long crevices, but grass grew thereand leaves out of them altogether, for the whole balcony outside, the yard,and the walls, were overgrown with so much green stuff, that it looked like agarden; only a balcony. Here stood old flower-pots with faces and asses' ears,and the flowers grew just as they liked. One of the pots was quite overrun onall sides with pinks, that is to say, with the green part; shoot stood byshoot, and it said quite distinctly, "The air has cherished me, the sun haskissed me, and promised me a little flower on Sunday! a little flower onSunday!"And then they entered a chamber where the walls were covered with hog'sleather, and printed with gold flowers."The gilding decays,But hog's leather stays!"said the walls.And there stood easy-chairs, with such high backs, and so carved out, and witharms on both sides. "Sit down! sit down!" said they. "Ugh! how I creak; now Ishall certainly get the gout, like the old clothespress, ugh!"And then the little boy came into the room where the projecting windows were,and where the old man sat."I thank you for the pewter soldier, my little friend!" said the old man. "AndI thank you because you come over to me.""Thankee! thankee!" or "cranky! cranky!" sounded from all the furniture; therewas so much of it, that each article stood in the other's way, to get a lookat the little boy.In the middle of the wall hung a picture representing a beautiful lady, soyoung, so glad, but dressed quite as in former times, with clothes that stoodquite stiff, and with powder in her hair; she neither said "thankee, thankee!"nor "cranky, cranky!" but looked with her mild eyes at the little boy, whodirectly asked the old man, "Where did you get her?""Yonder, at the broker's," said the old man, "where there are so many pictureshanging. No one knows or cares about them, for they are all of them buried;but I knew her in by-gone days, and now she has been dead and gone these fiftyyears!"Under the picture, in a glazed frame, there hung a bouquet of witheredflowers; they were almost fifty years old; they looked so very old!The pendulum of the great clock went to and fro, and the hands turned, andeverything in the room became still older; but they did not observe it."They say at home," said the little boy, "that you are so very, very lonely!""Oh!" said he. "The old thoughts, with what they may bring with them, come andvisit me, and now you also come! I am very well off!"Then he took a book with pictures in it down from the shelf; there werewhole long processions and pageants, with the strangest characters, which onenever sees now-a-days; soldiers like the knave of clubs, and citizens withwaving flags: the tailors had theirs, with a pair of shears held by twolions--and the shoemakers theirs, without boots, but with an eagle that hadtwo heads, for the shoemakers must have everything so that they can say, it isa pair! Yes, that was a picture book!The old man now went into the other room to fetch preserves, apples, andnuts--yes, it was delightful over there in the old house."I cannot bear it any longer!" said the pewter soldier, who sat on thedrawers. "It is so lonely and melancholy here! But when one has been in afamily circle one cannot accustom oneself to this life! I cannot bear it anylonger! The whole day is so long, and the evenings are still longer! Here itis not at all as it is over the way at your home, where your father andmother spoke so pleasantly, and where you and all your sweet children madesuch a delightful noise. Nay, how lonely the old man is--do you think that hegets kisses? Do you think he gets mild eyes, or a Christmas tree? He will getnothing but a grave! I can bear it no longer!""You must not let it grieve you so much," said the little boy. "I find it sovery delightful here, and then all the old thoughts, with what they may bringwith them, they come and visit here.""Yes, it's all very well, but I see nothing of them, and I don't know them!"said the pewter soldier. "I cannot bear it!""But you must!" said the little boy.Then in came the old man with the most pleased and happy face, the mostdelicious preserves, apples, and nuts, and so the little boy thought no moreabout the pewter soldier.The little boy returned home happy and pleased, and weeks and days passedaway, and nods were made to the old house, and from the old house, and thenthe little boy went over there again.The carved trumpeters blew, "Trateratra! There is the little boy! Trateratra!"and the swords and armor on the knights' portraits rattled, and the silk gownsrustled; the hog's leather spoke, and the old chairs had the gout in theirlegs and rheumatism in their backs: Ugh! it was exactly like the first time,for over there one day and hour was just like another."I cannot bear it!" said the pewter soldier. "I have shed pewter tears! It istoo melancholy! Rather let me go to the wars and lose arms and legs! It wouldat least be a change. I cannot bear it longer! Now, I know what it is to havea visit from one's old thoughts, with what they may bring with them! I havehad a visit from mine, and you may be sure it is no pleasant thing in the end;I was at last about to jump down from the drawers."I saw you all over there at home so distinctly, as if you really were here;it was again that Sunday morning; all you children stood before the table andsung your Psalms, as you do every morning. You stood devoutly with foldedhands; and father and mother were just as pious; and then the door was opened,and little sister Mary, who is not two years old yet, and who always danceswhen she hears music or singing, of whatever kind it may be, was put into theroom--though she ought not to have been there--and then she began to dance,but could not keep time, because the tones were so long; and then she stood,first on the one leg, and bent her head forwards, and then on the other leg,and bent her head forwards--but all would not do. You stood very seriously alltogether, although it was difficult enough; but I laughed to myself, and thenI fell off the table, and got a bump, which I have still--for it was notright of me to laugh. But the whole now passes before me again in thought, andeverything that I have lived to see; and these are the old thoughts, with whatthey may bring with them."Tell me if you still sing on Sundays? Tell me something about little Mary!And how my comrade, the other pewter soldier, lives! Yes, he is happy enough,that's sure! I cannot bear it any longer!""You are given away as a present!" said the little boy. "You must remain. Canyou not understand that?"The old man now came with a drawer, in which there was much to be seen, both"tin boxes" and "balsam boxes," old cards, so large and so gilded, such as onenever sees them now. And several drawers were opened, and the piano wasopened; it had landscapes on the inside of the lid, and it was so hoarse whenthe old man played on it! and then he hummed a song."Yes, she could sing that!" said he, and nodded to the portrait, which hehad bought at the broker's, and the old man's eyes shone so bright!"I will go to the wars! I will go to the wars!" shouted the pewter soldier asloud as he could, and threw himself off the drawers right down on the floor.What became of him? The old man sought, and the little boy sought; he wasaway, and he stayed away."I shall find him!" said the old man; but he never found him. The floor wastoo open--the pewter soldier had fallen through a crevice, and there he lay asin an open tomb.That day passed, and the little boy went home, and that week passed, andseveral weeks too. The windows were quite frozen, the little boy was obligedto sit and breathe on them to get a peep-hole over to the old house, and therethe snow had been blown into all the carved work and inscriptions; it layquite up over the steps, just as if there was no one at home--nor was thereany one at home--the old man was dead!In the evening there was a hearse seen before the door, and he was borne intoit in his coffin: he was now to go out into the country, to lie in his grave.He was driven out there, but no one followed; all his friends were dead, andthe little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as it was driven away.Some days afterwards there was an auction at the old house, and the little boysaw from his window how they carried the old knights and the old ladies away,the flower-pots with the long ears, the old chairs, and the oldclothes-presses. Something came here, and something came there; the portraitof her who had been found at the broker's came to the broker's again; andthere it hung, for no one knew her more--no one cared about the old picture.In the spring they pulled the house down, for, as people said, it was a ruin.One could see from the street right into the room with the hog's-leatherhanging, which was slashed and torn; and the green grass and leaves about thebalcony hung quite wild about the falling beams. And then it was put torights."That was a relief," said the neighboring houses.A fine house was built there, with large windows, and smooth white walls; butbefore it, where the old house had in fact stood, was a little garden laidout, and a wild grapevine ran up the wall of the neighboring house. Before thegarden there was a large iron railing with an iron door, it looked quitesplendid, and people stood still and peeped in, and the sparrows hung byscores in the vine, and chattered away at each other as well as they could,but it was not about the old house, for they could not remember it, so manyyears had passed--so many that the little boy had grown up to a whole man,yes, a clever man, and a pleasure to his parents; and he had just beenmarried, and, together with his little wife, had come to live in the househere, where the garden was; and he stood by her there whilst she planted afield-flower that she found so pretty; she planted it with her little hand,and pressed the earth around it with her fingers. Oh! what was that? She hadstuck herself. There sat something pointed, straight out of the soft mould.It was--yes, guess! It was the pewter soldier, he that was lost up at the oldman's, and had tumbled and turned about amongst the timber and the rubbish,and had at last laid for many years in the ground.The young wife wiped the dirt off the soldier, first with a green leaf, andthen with her fine handkerchief--it had such a delightful smell, that it wasto the pewter soldier just as if he had awaked from a trance."Let me see him," said the young man. He laughed, and then shook his head."Nay, it cannot be he; but he reminds me of a story about a pewter soldierwhich I had when I was a little boy!" And then he told his wife about the oldhouse, and the old man, and about the pewter soldier that he sent over to himbecause he was so very, very lonely; and he told it as correctly as it hadreally been, so that the tears came into the eyes of his young wife, onaccount of the old house and the old man."It may possibly be, however, that it is the same pewter soldier!" said she."I will take care of it, and remember all that you have told me; but you mustshow me the old man's grave!""But I do not know it," said he, "and no one knows it! All his friends weredead, no one took care of it, and I was then a little boy!""How very, very lonely he must have been!" said she."Very, very lonely!" said the pewter soldier. "But it is delightful not to beforgotten!""Delightful!" shouted something close by; but no one, except the pewtersoldier, saw that it was a piece of the hog's-leather hangings; it had lostall its gilding, it looked like a piece of wet clay, but it had an opinion,and it gave it:"The gilding decays,But hog's leather stays!"This the pewter soldier did not believe.8.2 Add  The Old House to your library.Return to the Hans Christian Andersen library, or . . .

And thenthere was a flight of stairs which went a good way upwards, and a little waydownwards, and then one came on a balcony which was in a very dilapidatedstate, sure enough, with large holes and long crevices, but grass grew thereand leaves out of them altogether, for the whole balcony outside, the yard,and the walls, were overgrown with so much green stuff, that it looked like agarden; only a balcony. Here stood old flower-pots with faces and asses' ears,and the flowers grew just as they liked. One of the pots was quite overrun onall sides with pinks, that is to say, with the green part; shoot stood byshoot, and it said quite distinctly, "The air has cherished me, the sun haskissed me, and promised me a little flower on Sunday! a little flower onSunday!"And then they entered a chamber where the walls were covered with hog'sleather, and printed with gold flowers."The gilding decays,But hog's leather stays!"said the walls.And there stood easy-chairs, with such high backs, and so carved out, and witharms on both sides. "Sit down! sit down!" said they. "Ugh! how I creak; now Ishall certainly get the gout, like the old clothespress, ugh!"And then the little boy came into the room where the projecting windows were,and where the old man sat."I thank you for the pewter soldier, my little friend!" said the old man. "AndI thank you because you come over to me.""Thankee! thankee!" or "cranky! cranky!" sounded from all the furniture; therewas so much of it, that each article stood in the other's way, to get a lookat the little boy.In the middle of the wall hung a picture representing a beautiful lady, soyoung, so glad, but dressed quite as in former times, with clothes that stoodquite stiff, and with powder in her hair; she neither said "thankee, thankee!"nor "cranky, cranky!" but looked with her mild eyes at the little boy, whodirectly asked the old man, "Where did you get her?""Yonder, at the broker's," said the old man, "where there are so many pictureshanging. No one knows or cares about them, for they are all of them buried;but I knew her in by-gone days, and now she has been dead and gone these fiftyyears!"Under the picture, in a glazed frame, there hung a bouquet of witheredflowers; they were almost fifty years old; they looked so very old!The pendulum of the great clock went to and fro, and the hands turned, andeverything in the room became still older; but they did not observe it."They say at home," said the little boy, "that you are so very, very lonely!""Oh!" said he. "The old thoughts, with what they may bring with them, come andvisit me, and now you also come! I am very well off!"Then he took a book with pictures in it down from the shelf; there werewhole long processions and pageants, with the strangest characters, which onenever sees now-a-days; soldiers like the knave of clubs, and citizens withwaving flags: the tailors had theirs, with a pair of shears held by twolions--and the shoemakers theirs, without boots, but with an eagle that hadtwo heads, for the shoemakers must have everything so that they can say, it isa pair! Yes, that was a picture book!The old man now went into the other room to fetch preserves, apples, andnuts--yes, it was delightful over there in the old house."I cannot bear it any longer!" said the pewter soldier, who sat on thedrawers. "It is so lonely and melancholy here! But when one has been in afamily circle one cannot accustom oneself to this life! I cannot bear it anylonger! The whole day is so long, and the evenings are still longer! Here itis not at all as it is over the way at your home, where your father andmother spoke so pleasantly, and where you and all your sweet children madesuch a delightful noise. Nay, how lonely the old man is--do you think that hegets kisses? Do you think he gets mild eyes, or a Christmas tree? He will getnothing but a grave! I can bear it no longer!""You must not let it grieve you so much," said the little boy. "I find it sovery delightful here, and then all the old thoughts, with what they may bringwith them, they come and visit here.""Yes, it's all very well, but I see nothing of them, and I don't know them!"said the pewter soldier. "I cannot bear it!""But you must!" said the little boy.Then in came the old man with the most pleased and happy face, the mostdelicious preserves, apples, and nuts, and so the little boy thought no moreabout the pewter soldier.The little boy returned home happy and pleased, and weeks and days passedaway, and nods were made to the old house, and from the old house, and thenthe little boy went over there again.The carved trumpeters blew, "Trateratra! There is the little boy! Trateratra!"and the swords and armor on the knights' portraits rattled, and the silk gownsrustled; the hog's leather spoke, and the old chairs had the gout in theirlegs and rheumatism in their backs: Ugh! it was exactly like the first time,for over there one day and hour was just like another."I cannot bear it!" said the pewter soldier. "I have shed pewter tears! It istoo melancholy! Rather let me go to the wars and lose arms and legs! It wouldat least be a change. I cannot bear it longer! Now, I know what it is to havea visit from one's old thoughts, with what they may bring with them! I havehad a visit from mine, and you may be sure it is no pleasant thing in the end;I was at last about to jump down from the drawers."I saw you all over there at home so distinctly, as if you really were here;it was again that Sunday morning; all you children stood before the table andsung your Psalms, as you do every morning. You stood devoutly with foldedhands; and father and mother were just as pious; and then the door was opened,and little sister Mary, who is not two years old yet, and who always danceswhen she hears music or singing, of whatever kind it may be, was put into theroom--though she ought not to have been there--and then she began to dance,but could not keep time, because the tones were so long; and then she stood,first on the one leg, and bent her head forwards, and then on the other leg,and bent her head forwards--but all would not do. You stood very seriously alltogether, although it was difficult enough; but I laughed to myself, and thenI fell off the table, and got a bump, which I have still--for it was notright of me to laugh. But the whole now passes before me again in thought, andeverything that I have lived to see; and these are the old thoughts, with whatthey may bring with them."Tell me if you still sing on Sundays? Tell me something about little Mary!And how my comrade, the other pewter soldier, lives! Yes, he is happy enough,that's sure! I cannot bear it any longer!""You are given away as a present!" said the little boy. "You must remain. Canyou not understand that?"The old man now came with a drawer, in which there was much to be seen, both"tin boxes" and "balsam boxes," old cards, so large and so gilded, such as onenever sees them now. And several drawers were opened, and the piano wasopened; it had landscapes on the inside of the lid, and it was so hoarse whenthe old man played on it! and then he hummed a song."Yes, she could sing that!" said he, and nodded to the portrait, which hehad bought at the broker's, and the old man's eyes shone so bright!"I will go to the wars! I will go to the wars!" shouted the pewter soldier asloud as he could, and threw himself off the drawers right down on the floor.What became of him? The old man sought, and the little boy sought; he wasaway, and he stayed away."I shall find him!" said the old man; but he never found him. The floor wastoo open--the pewter soldier had fallen through a crevice, and there he lay asin an open tomb.That day passed, and the little boy went home, and that week passed, andseveral weeks too. The windows were quite frozen, the little boy was obligedto sit and breathe on them to get a peep-hole over to the old house, and therethe snow had been blown into all the carved work and inscriptions; it layquite up over the steps, just as if there was no one at home--nor was thereany one at home--the old man was dead!In the evening there was a hearse seen before the door, and he was borne intoit in his coffin: he was now to go out into the country, to lie in his grave.He was driven out there, but no one followed; all his friends were dead, andthe little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as it was driven away.Some days afterwards there was an auction at the old house, and the little boysaw from his window how they carried the old knights and the old ladies away,the flower-pots with the long ears, the old chairs, and the oldclothes-presses. Something came here, and something came there; the portraitof her who had been found at the broker's came to the broker's again; andthere it hung, for no one knew her more--no one cared about the old picture.In the spring they pulled the house down, for, as people said, it was a ruin.One could see from the street right into the room with the hog's-leatherhanging, which was slashed and torn; and the green grass and leaves about thebalcony hung quite wild about the falling beams. And then it was put torights."That was a relief," said the neighboring houses.A fine house was built there, with large windows, and smooth white walls; butbefore it, where the old house had in fact stood, was a little garden laidout, and a wild grapevine ran up the wall of the neighboring house. Before thegarden there was a large iron railing with an iron door, it looked quitesplendid, and people stood still and peeped in, and the sparrows hung byscores in the vine, and chattered away at each other as well as they could,but it was not about the old house, for they could not remember it, so manyyears had passed--so many that the little boy had grown up to a whole man,yes, a clever man, and a pleasure to his parents; and he had just beenmarried, and, together with his little wife, had come to live in the househere, where the garden was; and he stood by her there whilst she planted afield-flower that she found so pretty; she planted it with her little hand,and pressed the earth around it with her fingers. Oh! what was that? She hadstuck herself. There sat something pointed, straight out of the soft mould.It was--yes, guess! It was the pewter soldier, he that was lost up at the oldman's, and had tumbled and turned about amongst the timber and the rubbish,and had at last laid for many years in the ground.The young wife wiped the dirt off the soldier, first with a green leaf, andthen with her fine handkerchief--it had such a delightful smell, that it wasto the pewter soldier just as if he had awaked from a trance."Let me see him," said the young man. He laughed, and then shook his head."Nay, it cannot be he; but he reminds me of a story about a pewter soldierwhich I had when I was a little boy!" And then he told his wife about the oldhouse, and the old man, and about the pewter soldier that he sent over to himbecause he was so very, very lonely; and he told it as correctly as it hadreally been, so that the tears came into the eyes of his young wife, onaccount of the old house and the old man."It may possibly be, however, that it is the same pewter soldier!" said she."I will take care of it, and remember all that you have told me; but you mustshow me the old man's grave!""But I do not know it," said he, "and no one knows it! All his friends weredead, no one took care of it, and I was then a little boy!""How very, very lonely he must have been!" said she."Very, very lonely!" said the pewter soldier. "But it is delightful not to beforgotten!""Delightful!" shouted something close by; but no one, except the pewtersoldier, saw that it was a piece of the hog's-leather hangings; it had lostall its gilding, it looked like a piece of wet clay, but it had an opinion,and it gave it:"The gilding decays,But hog's leather stays!"This the pewter soldier did not believe.8.2 Add  The Old House to your library.Return to the Hans Christian Andersen library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Princess and the Pea The Sunday following, the little boy took something, and wrapped it up in apiece of paper, went downstairs, and stood in the doorway; and when the manwho went on errands came past, he said to him--"I say, master! will you give this to the old man over the way from me? I havetwo pewter soldiers--this is one of them, and he shall have it, for I know heis so very, very lonely."And the old errand man looked quite pleased, nodded, and took the pewtersoldier over to the old house. Afterwards there came a message; it was to askif the little boy himself had not a wish to come over and pay a visit; and sohe got permission of his parents, and then went over to the old house.And the brass balls on the iron railings shone much brighter than ever; onewould have thought they were polished on account of the visit; and it was asif the carved-out trumpeters--for there were trumpeters, who stood in tulips,carved out on the door--blew with all their might, their cheeks appeared somuch rounder than before. Yes, they blew--"Trateratra! The little boy comes!Trateratra!"--and then the door opened.The whole passage was hung with portraits of knights in armor, and ladies insilken gowns; and the armor rattled, and the silken gowns rustled! And thenthere was a flight of stairs which went a good way upwards, and a little waydownwards, and then one came on a balcony which was in a very dilapidatedstate, sure enough, with large holes and long crevices, but grass grew thereand leaves out of them altogether, for the whole balcony outside, the yard,and the walls, were overgrown with so much green stuff, that it looked like agarden; only a balcony.

Tell me something about little Mary!And how my comrade, the other pewter soldier, lives! Yes, he is happy enough,that's sure! I cannot bear it any longer!""You are given away as a present!" said the little boy. "You must remain. Canyou not understand that?"The old man now came with a drawer, in which there was much to be seen, both"tin boxes" and "balsam boxes," old cards, so large and so gilded, such as onenever sees them now. And several drawers were opened, and the piano wasopened; it had landscapes on the inside of the lid, and it was so hoarse whenthe old man played on it! and then he hummed a song."Yes, she could sing that!" said he, and nodded to the portrait, which hehad bought at the broker's, and the old man's eyes shone so bright!"I will go to the wars! I will go to the wars!" shouted the pewter soldier asloud as he could, and threw himself off the drawers right down on the floor.What became of him? The old man sought, and the little boy sought; he wasaway, and he stayed away."I shall find him!" said the old man; but he never found him. The floor wastoo open--the pewter soldier had fallen through a crevice, and there he lay asin an open tomb.That day passed, and the little boy went home, and that week passed, andseveral weeks too. The windows were quite frozen, the little boy was obligedto sit and breathe on them to get a peep-hole over to the old house, and therethe snow had been blown into all the carved work and inscriptions; it layquite up over the steps, just as if there was no one at home--nor was thereany one at home--the old man was dead!In the evening there was a hearse seen before the door, and he was borne intoit in his coffin: he was now to go out into the country, to lie in his grave.He was driven out there, but no one followed; all his friends were dead, andthe little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as it was driven away.Some days afterwards there was an auction at the old house, and the little boysaw from his window how they carried the old knights and the old ladies away,the flower-pots with the long ears, the old chairs, and the oldclothes-presses. Something came here, and something came there; the portraitof her who had been found at the broker's came to the broker's again; andthere it hung, for no one knew her more--no one cared about the old picture.In the spring they pulled the house down, for, as people said, it was a ruin.One could see from the street right into the room with the hog's-leatherhanging, which was slashed and torn; and the green grass and leaves about thebalcony hung quite wild about the falling beams. And then it was put torights."That was a relief," said the neighboring houses.A fine house was built there, with large windows, and smooth white walls; butbefore it, where the old house had in fact stood, was a little garden laidout, and a wild grapevine ran up the wall of the neighboring house. Before thegarden there was a large iron railing with an iron door, it looked quitesplendid, and people stood still and peeped in, and the sparrows hung byscores in the vine, and chattered away at each other as well as they could,but it was not about the old house, for they could not remember it, so manyyears had passed--so many that the little boy had grown up to a whole man,yes, a clever man, and a pleasure to his parents; and he had just beenmarried, and, together with his little wife, had come to live in the househere, where the garden was; and he stood by her there whilst she planted afield-flower that she found so pretty; she planted it with her little hand,and pressed the earth around it with her fingers. Oh! what was that? She hadstuck herself. There sat something pointed, straight out of the soft mould.It was--yes, guess! It was the pewter soldier, he that was lost up at the oldman's, and had tumbled and turned about amongst the timber and the rubbish,and had at last laid for many years in the ground.The young wife wiped the dirt off the soldier, first with a green leaf, andthen with her fine handkerchief--it had such a delightful smell, that it wasto the pewter soldier just as if he had awaked from a trance."Let me see him," said the young man. He laughed, and then shook his head."Nay, it cannot be he; but he reminds me of a story about a pewter soldierwhich I had when I was a little boy!" And then he told his wife about the oldhouse, and the old man, and about the pewter soldier that he sent over to himbecause he was so very, very lonely; and he told it as correctly as it hadreally been, so that the tears came into the eyes of his young wife, onaccount of the old house and the old man."It may possibly be, however, that it is the same pewter soldier!" said she."I will take care of it, and remember all that you have told me; but you mustshow me the old man's grave!""But I do not know it," said he, "and no one knows it! All his friends weredead, no one took care of it, and I was then a little boy!""How very, very lonely he must have been!" said she."Very, very lonely!" said the pewter soldier. "But it is delightful not to beforgotten!""Delightful!" shouted something close by; but no one, except the pewtersoldier, saw that it was a piece of the hog's-leather hangings; it had lostall its gilding, it looked like a piece of wet clay, but it had an opinion,and it gave it:"The gilding decays,But hog's leather stays!"This the pewter soldier did not believe.8.2 Add  The Old House to your library.Return to the Hans Christian Andersen library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Princess and the Pea And the old errand man looked quite pleased, nodded, and took the pewtersoldier over to the old house. Afterwards there came a message; it was to askif the little boy himself had not a wish to come over and pay a visit; and sohe got permission of his parents, and then went over to the old house.And the brass balls on the iron railings shone much brighter than ever; onewould have thought they were polished on account of the visit; and it was asif the carved-out trumpeters--for there were trumpeters, who stood in tulips,carved out on the door--blew with all their might, their cheeks appeared somuch rounder than before. Yes, they blew--"Trateratra! The little boy comes!Trateratra!"--and then the door opened.The whole passage was hung with portraits of knights in armor, and ladies insilken gowns; and the armor rattled, and the silken gowns rustled! And thenthere was a flight of stairs which went a good way upwards, and a little waydownwards, and then one came on a balcony which was in a very dilapidatedstate, sure enough, with large holes and long crevices, but grass grew thereand leaves out of them altogether, for the whole balcony outside, the yard,and the walls, were overgrown with so much green stuff, that it looked like agarden; only a balcony. Here stood old flower-pots with faces and asses' ears,and the flowers grew just as they liked. One of the pots was quite overrun onall sides with pinks, that is to say, with the green part; shoot stood byshoot, and it said quite distinctly, "The air has cherished me, the sun haskissed me, and promised me a little flower on Sunday! a little flower onSunday!"And then they entered a chamber where the walls were covered with hog'sleather, and printed with gold flowers."The gilding decays,But hog's leather stays!"said the walls.And there stood easy-chairs, with such high backs, and so carved out, and witharms on both sides. "Sit down! sit down!" said they. "Ugh! how I creak; now Ishall certainly get the gout, like the old clothespress, ugh!"And then the little boy came into the room where the projecting windows were,and where the old man sat."I thank you for the pewter soldier, my little friend!" said the old man. "AndI thank you because you come over to me.""Thankee! thankee!" or "cranky! cranky!" sounded from all the furniture; therewas so much of it, that each article stood in the other's way, to get a lookat the little boy.In the middle of the wall hung a picture representing a beautiful lady, soyoung, so glad, but dressed quite as in former times, with clothes that stoodquite stiff, and with powder in her hair; she neither said "thankee, thankee!"nor "cranky, cranky!" but looked with her mild eyes at the little boy, whodirectly asked the old man, "Where did you get her?""Yonder, at the broker's," said the old man, "where there are so many pictureshanging. No one knows or cares about them, for they are all of them buried;but I knew her in by-gone days, and now she has been dead and gone these fiftyyears!"Under the picture, in a glazed frame, there hung a bouquet of witheredflowers; they were almost fifty years old; they looked so very old!The pendulum of the great clock went to and fro, and the hands turned, andeverything in the room became still older; but they did not observe it."They say at home," said the little boy, "that you are so very, very lonely!""Oh!" said he. "The old thoughts, with what they may bring with them, come andvisit me, and now you also come! I am very well off!"Then he took a book with pictures in it down from the shelf; there werewhole long processions and pageants, with the strangest characters, which onenever sees now-a-days; soldiers like the knave of clubs, and citizens withwaving flags: the tailors had theirs, with a pair of shears held by twolions--and the shoemakers theirs, without boots, but with an eagle that hadtwo heads, for the shoemakers must have everything so that they can say, it isa pair! Yes, that was a picture book!The old man now went into the other room to fetch preserves, apples, andnuts--yes, it was delightful over there in the old house."I cannot bear it any longer!" said the pewter soldier, who sat on thedrawers. "It is so lonely and melancholy here! But when one has been in afamily circle one cannot accustom oneself to this life! I cannot bear it anylonger! The whole day is so long, and the evenings are still longer! Here itis not at all as it is over the way at your home, where your father andmother spoke so pleasantly, and where you and all your sweet children madesuch a delightful noise. Nay, how lonely the old man is--do you think that hegets kisses? Do you think he gets mild eyes, or a Christmas tree? He will getnothing but a grave! I can bear it no longer!""You must not let it grieve you so much," said the little boy. "I find it sovery delightful here, and then all the old thoughts, with what they may bringwith them, they come and visit here.""Yes, it's all very well, but I see nothing of them, and I don't know them!"said the pewter soldier. "I cannot bear it!""But you must!" said the little boy.Then in came the old man with the most pleased and happy face, the mostdelicious preserves, apples, and nuts, and so the little boy thought no moreabout the pewter soldier.The little boy returned home happy and pleased, and weeks and days passedaway, and nods were made to the old house, and from the old house, and thenthe little boy went over there again.The carved trumpeters blew, "Trateratra! There is the little boy! Trateratra!"and the swords and armor on the knights' portraits rattled, and the silk gownsrustled; the hog's leather spoke, and the old chairs had the gout in theirlegs and rheumatism in their backs: Ugh! it was exactly like the first time,for over there one day and hour was just like another."I cannot bear it!" said the pewter soldier. "I have shed pewter tears! It istoo melancholy! Rather let me go to the wars and lose arms and legs! It wouldat least be a change. I cannot bear it longer! Now, I know what it is to havea visit from one's old thoughts, with what they may bring with them! I havehad a visit from mine, and you may be sure it is no pleasant thing in the end;I was at last about to jump down from the drawers."I saw you all over there at home so distinctly, as if you really were here;it was again that Sunday morning; all you children stood before the table andsung your Psalms, as you do every morning. You stood devoutly with foldedhands; and father and mother were just as pious; and then the door was opened,and little sister Mary, who is not two years old yet, and who always danceswhen she hears music or singing, of whatever kind it may be, was put into theroom--though she ought not to have been there--and then she began to dance,but could not keep time, because the tones were so long; and then she stood,first on the one leg, and bent her head forwards, and then on the other leg,and bent her head forwards--but all would not do. You stood very seriously alltogether, although it was difficult enough; but I laughed to myself, and thenI fell off the table, and got a bump, which I have still--for it was notright of me to laugh. But the whole now passes before me again in thought, andeverything that I have lived to see; and these are the old thoughts, with whatthey may bring with them."Tell me if you still sing on Sundays? Tell me something about little Mary!And how my comrade, the other pewter soldier, lives! Yes, he is happy enough,that's sure! I cannot bear it any longer!""You are given away as a present!" said the little boy. "You must remain. Canyou not understand that?"The old man now came with a drawer, in which there was much to be seen, both"tin boxes" and "balsam boxes," old cards, so large and so gilded, such as onenever sees them now. And several drawers were opened, and the piano wasopened; it had landscapes on the inside of the lid, and it was so hoarse whenthe old man played on it! and then he hummed a song."Yes, she could sing that!" said he, and nodded to the portrait, which hehad bought at the broker's, and the old man's eyes shone so bright!"I will go to the wars! I will go to the wars!" shouted the pewter soldier asloud as he could, and threw himself off the drawers right down on the floor.What became of him? The old man sought, and the little boy sought; he wasaway, and he stayed away."I shall find him!" said the old man; but he never found him.

The windows were quite frozen, the little boy was obligedto sit and breathe on them to get a peep-hole over to the old house, and therethe snow had been blown into all the carved work and inscriptions; it layquite up over the steps, just as if there was no one at home--nor was thereany one at home--the old man was dead!In the evening there was a hearse seen before the door, and he was borne intoit in his coffin: he was now to go out into the country, to lie in his grave.He was driven out there, but no one followed; all his friends were dead, andthe little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as it was driven away.Some days afterwards there was an auction at the old house, and the little boysaw from his window how they carried the old knights and the old ladies away,the flower-pots with the long ears, the old chairs, and the oldclothes-presses.

"AndI thank you because you come over to me.""Thankee! thankee!" or "cranky! cranky!" sounded from all the furniture; therewas so much of it, that each article stood in the other's way, to get a lookat the little boy.In the middle of the wall hung a picture representing a beautiful lady, soyoung, so glad, but dressed quite as in former times, with clothes that stoodquite stiff, and with powder in her hair; she neither said "thankee, thankee!"nor "cranky, cranky!" but looked with her mild eyes at the little boy, whodirectly asked the old man, "Where did you get her?""Yonder, at the broker's," said the old man, "where there are so many pictureshanging. No one knows or cares about them, for they are all of them buried;but I knew her in by-gone days, and now she has been dead and gone these fiftyyears!"Under the picture, in a glazed frame, there hung a bouquet of witheredflowers; they were almost fifty years old; they looked so very old!The pendulum of the great clock went to and fro, and the hands turned, andeverything in the room became still older; but they did not observe it."They say at home," said the little boy, "that you are so very, very lonely!""Oh!" said he. "The old thoughts, with what they may bring with them, come andvisit me, and now you also come! I am very well off!"Then he took a book with pictures in it down from the shelf; there werewhole long processions and pageants, with the strangest characters, which onenever sees now-a-days; soldiers like the knave of clubs, and citizens withwaving flags: the tailors had theirs, with a pair of shears held by twolions--and the shoemakers theirs, without boots, but with an eagle that hadtwo heads, for the shoemakers must have everything so that they can say, it isa pair! Yes, that was a picture book!The old man now went into the other room to fetch preserves, apples, andnuts--yes, it was delightful over there in the old house."I cannot bear it any longer!" said the pewter soldier, who sat on thedrawers. "It is so lonely and melancholy here! But when one has been in afamily circle one cannot accustom oneself to this life! I cannot bear it anylonger! The whole day is so long, and the evenings are still longer! Here itis not at all as it is over the way at your home, where your father andmother spoke so pleasantly, and where you and all your sweet children madesuch a delightful noise. Nay, how lonely the old man is--do you think that hegets kisses? Do you think he gets mild eyes, or a Christmas tree? He will getnothing but a grave! I can bear it no longer!""You must not let it grieve you so much," said the little boy. "I find it sovery delightful here, and then all the old thoughts, with what they may bringwith them, they come and visit here.""Yes, it's all very well, but I see nothing of them, and I don't know them!"said the pewter soldier. "I cannot bear it!""But you must!" said the little boy.Then in came the old man with the most pleased and happy face, the mostdelicious preserves, apples, and nuts, and so the little boy thought no moreabout the pewter soldier.The little boy returned home happy and pleased, and weeks and days passedaway, and nods were made to the old house, and from the old house, and thenthe little boy went over there again.The carved trumpeters blew, "Trateratra! There is the little boy! Trateratra!"and the swords and armor on the knights' portraits rattled, and the silk gownsrustled; the hog's leather spoke, and the old chairs had the gout in theirlegs and rheumatism in their backs: Ugh! it was exactly like the first time,for over there one day and hour was just like another."I cannot bear it!" said the pewter soldier. "I have shed pewter tears! It istoo melancholy! Rather let me go to the wars and lose arms and legs! It wouldat least be a change. I cannot bear it longer! Now, I know what it is to havea visit from one's old thoughts, with what they may bring with them! I havehad a visit from mine, and you may be sure it is no pleasant thing in the end;I was at last about to jump down from the drawers."I saw you all over there at home so distinctly, as if you really were here;it was again that Sunday morning; all you children stood before the table andsung your Psalms, as you do every morning. You stood devoutly with foldedhands; and father and mother were just as pious; and then the door was opened,and little sister Mary, who is not two years old yet, and who always danceswhen she hears music or singing, of whatever kind it may be, was put into theroom--though she ought not to have been there--and then she began to dance,but could not keep time, because the tones were so long; and then she stood,first on the one leg, and bent her head forwards, and then on the other leg,and bent her head forwards--but all would not do. You stood very seriously alltogether, although it was difficult enough; but I laughed to myself, and thenI fell off the table, and got a bump, which I have still--for it was notright of me to laugh. But the whole now passes before me again in thought, andeverything that I have lived to see; and these are the old thoughts, with whatthey may bring with them."Tell me if you still sing on Sundays? Tell me something about little Mary!And how my comrade, the other pewter soldier, lives! Yes, he is happy enough,that's sure! I cannot bear it any longer!""You are given away as a present!" said the little boy. "You must remain. Canyou not understand that?"The old man now came with a drawer, in which there was much to be seen, both"tin boxes" and "balsam boxes," old cards, so large and so gilded, such as onenever sees them now. And several drawers were opened, and the piano wasopened; it had landscapes on the inside of the lid, and it was so hoarse whenthe old man played on it! and then he hummed a song."Yes, she could sing that!" said he, and nodded to the portrait, which hehad bought at the broker's, and the old man's eyes shone so bright!"I will go to the wars! I will go to the wars!" shouted the pewter soldier asloud as he could, and threw himself off the drawers right down on the floor.What became of him? The old man sought, and the little boy sought; he wasaway, and he stayed away."I shall find him!" said the old man; but he never found him. The floor wastoo open--the pewter soldier had fallen through a crevice, and there he lay asin an open tomb.That day passed, and the little boy went home, and that week passed, andseveral weeks too. The windows were quite frozen, the little boy was obligedto sit and breathe on them to get a peep-hole over to the old house, and therethe snow had been blown into all the carved work and inscriptions; it layquite up over the steps, just as if there was no one at home--nor was thereany one at home--the old man was dead!In the evening there was a hearse seen before the door, and he was borne intoit in his coffin: he was now to go out into the country, to lie in his grave.He was driven out there, but no one followed; all his friends were dead, andthe little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as it was driven away.Some days afterwards there was an auction at the old house, and the little boysaw from his window how they carried the old knights and the old ladies away,the flower-pots with the long ears, the old chairs, and the oldclothes-presses. Something came here, and something came there; the portraitof her who had been found at the broker's came to the broker's again; andthere it hung, for no one knew her more--no one cared about the old picture.In the spring they pulled the house down, for, as people said, it was a ruin.One could see from the street right into the room with the hog's-leatherhanging, which was slashed and torn; and the green grass and leaves about thebalcony hung quite wild about the falling beams. And then it was put torights."That was a relief," said the neighboring houses.A fine house was built there, with large windows, and smooth white walls; butbefore it, where the old house had in fact stood, was a little garden laidout, and a wild grapevine ran up the wall of the neighboring house. Before thegarden there was a large iron railing with an iron door, it looked quitesplendid, and people stood still and peeped in, and the sparrows hung byscores in the vine, and chattered away at each other as well as they could,but it was not about the old house, for they could not remember it, so manyyears had passed--so many that the little boy had grown up to a whole man,yes, a clever man, and a pleasure to his parents; and he had just beenmarried, and, together with his little wife, had come to live in the househere, where the garden was; and he stood by her there whilst she planted afield-flower that she found so pretty; she planted it with her little hand,and pressed the earth around it with her fingers. Oh! what was that? She hadstuck herself. There sat something pointed, straight out of the soft mould.It was--yes, guess! It was the pewter soldier, he that was lost up at the oldman's, and had tumbled and turned about amongst the timber and the rubbish,and had at last laid for many years in the ground.The young wife wiped the dirt off the soldier, first with a green leaf, andthen with her fine handkerchief--it had such a delightful smell, that it wasto the pewter soldier just as if he had awaked from a trance."Let me see him," said the young man. He laughed, and then shook his head."Nay, it cannot be he; but he reminds me of a story about a pewter soldierwhich I had when I was a little boy!" And then he told his wife about the oldhouse, and the old man, and about the pewter soldier that he sent over to himbecause he was so very, very lonely; and he told it as correctly as it hadreally been, so that the tears came into the eyes of his young wife, onaccount of the old house and the old man."It may possibly be, however, that it is the same pewter soldier!" said she."I will take care of it, and remember all that you have told me; but you mustshow me the old man's grave!""But I do not know it," said he, "and no one knows it! All his friends weredead, no one took care of it, and I was then a little boy!""How very, very lonely he must have been!" said she."Very, very lonely!" said the pewter soldier. "But it is delightful not to beforgotten!""Delightful!" shouted something close by; but no one, except the pewtersoldier, saw that it was a piece of the hog's-leather hangings; it had lostall its gilding, it looked like a piece of wet clay, but it had an opinion,and it gave it:"The gilding decays,But hog's leather stays!"This the pewter soldier did not believe.8.2 Add  The Old House to your library.Return to the Hans Christian Andersen library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Princess and the Pea And then they entered a chamber where the walls were covered with hog'sleather, and printed with gold flowers."The gilding decays,But hog's leather stays!"said the walls.And there stood easy-chairs, with such high backs, and so carved out, and witharms on both sides. "Sit down! sit down!" said they. "Ugh! how I creak; now Ishall certainly get the gout, like the old clothespress, ugh!"And then the little boy came into the room where the projecting windows were,and where the old man sat."I thank you for the pewter soldier, my little friend!" said the old man.

"But it is delightful not to beforgotten!""Delightful!" shouted something close by; but no one, except the pewtersoldier, saw that it was a piece of the hog's-leather hangings; it had lostall its gilding, it looked like a piece of wet clay, but it had an opinion,and it gave it:"The gilding decays,But hog's leather stays!"This the pewter soldier did not believe.8.2 Add  The Old House to your library.Return to the Hans Christian Andersen library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Princess and the Pea said the walls.And there stood easy-chairs, with such high backs, and so carved out, and witharms on both sides. "Sit down! sit down!" said they. "Ugh! how I creak; now Ishall certainly get the gout, like the old clothespress, ugh!"And then the little boy came into the room where the projecting windows were,and where the old man sat."I thank you for the pewter soldier, my little friend!" said the old man. "AndI thank you because you come over to me.""Thankee! thankee!" or "cranky! cranky!" sounded from all the furniture; therewas so much of it, that each article stood in the other's way, to get a lookat the little boy.In the middle of the wall hung a picture representing a beautiful lady, soyoung, so glad, but dressed quite as in former times, with clothes that stoodquite stiff, and with powder in her hair; she neither said "thankee, thankee!"nor "cranky, cranky!" but looked with her mild eyes at the little boy, whodirectly asked the old man, "Where did you get her?""Yonder, at the broker's," said the old man, "where there are so many pictureshanging. No one knows or cares about them, for they are all of them buried;but I knew her in by-gone days, and now she has been dead and gone these fiftyyears!"Under the picture, in a glazed frame, there hung a bouquet of witheredflowers; they were almost fifty years old; they looked so very old!The pendulum of the great clock went to and fro, and the hands turned, andeverything in the room became still older; but they did not observe it."They say at home," said the little boy, "that you are so very, very lonely!""Oh!" said he. "The old thoughts, with what they may bring with them, come andvisit me, and now you also come! I am very well off!"Then he took a book with pictures in it down from the shelf; there werewhole long processions and pageants, with the strangest characters, which onenever sees now-a-days; soldiers like the knave of clubs, and citizens withwaving flags: the tailors had theirs, with a pair of shears held by twolions--and the shoemakers theirs, without boots, but with an eagle that hadtwo heads, for the shoemakers must have everything so that they can say, it isa pair! Yes, that was a picture book!The old man now went into the other room to fetch preserves, apples, andnuts--yes, it was delightful over there in the old house."I cannot bear it any longer!" said the pewter soldier, who sat on thedrawers. "It is so lonely and melancholy here! But when one has been in afamily circle one cannot accustom oneself to this life! I cannot bear it anylonger! The whole day is so long, and the evenings are still longer! Here itis not at all as it is over the way at your home, where your father andmother spoke so pleasantly, and where you and all your sweet children madesuch a delightful noise. Nay, how lonely the old man is--do you think that hegets kisses? Do you think he gets mild eyes, or a Christmas tree? He will getnothing but a grave! I can bear it no longer!""You must not let it grieve you so much," said the little boy. "I find it sovery delightful here, and then all the old thoughts, with what they may bringwith them, they come and visit here.""Yes, it's all very well, but I see nothing of them, and I don't know them!"said the pewter soldier. "I cannot bear it!""But you must!" said the little boy.Then in came the old man with the most pleased and happy face, the mostdelicious preserves, apples, and nuts, and so the little boy thought no moreabout the pewter soldier.The little boy returned home happy and pleased, and weeks and days passedaway, and nods were made to the old house, and from the old house, and thenthe little boy went over there again.The carved trumpeters blew, "Trateratra! There is the little boy! Trateratra!"and the swords and armor on the knights' portraits rattled, and the silk gownsrustled; the hog's leather spoke, and the old chairs had the gout in theirlegs and rheumatism in their backs: Ugh! it was exactly like the first time,for over there one day and hour was just like another."I cannot bear it!" said the pewter soldier. "I have shed pewter tears! It istoo melancholy! Rather let me go to the wars and lose arms and legs! It wouldat least be a change. I cannot bear it longer! Now, I know what it is to havea visit from one's old thoughts, with what they may bring with them! I havehad a visit from mine, and you may be sure it is no pleasant thing in the end;I was at last about to jump down from the drawers."I saw you all over there at home so distinctly, as if you really were here;it was again that Sunday morning; all you children stood before the table andsung your Psalms, as you do every morning. You stood devoutly with foldedhands; and father and mother were just as pious; and then the door was opened,and little sister Mary, who is not two years old yet, and who always danceswhen she hears music or singing, of whatever kind it may be, was put into theroom--though she ought not to have been there--and then she began to dance,but could not keep time, because the tones were so long; and then she stood,first on the one leg, and bent her head forwards, and then on the other leg,and bent her head forwards--but all would not do. You stood very seriously alltogether, although it was difficult enough; but I laughed to myself, and thenI fell off the table, and got a bump, which I have still--for it was notright of me to laugh. But the whole now passes before me again in thought, andeverything that I have lived to see; and these are the old thoughts, with whatthey may bring with them."Tell me if you still sing on Sundays? Tell me something about little Mary!And how my comrade, the other pewter soldier, lives! Yes, he is happy enough,that's sure! I cannot bear it any longer!""You are given away as a present!" said the little boy. "You must remain. Canyou not understand that?"The old man now came with a drawer, in which there was much to be seen, both"tin boxes" and "balsam boxes," old cards, so large and so gilded, such as onenever sees them now. And several drawers were opened, and the piano wasopened; it had landscapes on the inside of the lid, and it was so hoarse whenthe old man played on it! and then he hummed a song."Yes, she could sing that!" said he, and nodded to the portrait, which hehad bought at the broker's, and the old man's eyes shone so bright!"I will go to the wars! I will go to the wars!" shouted the pewter soldier asloud as he could, and threw himself off the drawers right down on the floor.What became of him? The old man sought, and the little boy sought; he wasaway, and he stayed away."I shall find him!" said the old man; but he never found him. The floor wastoo open--the pewter soldier had fallen through a crevice, and there he lay asin an open tomb.That day passed, and the little boy went home, and that week passed, andseveral weeks too. The windows were quite frozen, the little boy was obligedto sit and breathe on them to get a peep-hole over to the old house, and therethe snow had been blown into all the carved work and inscriptions; it layquite up over the steps, just as if there was no one at home--nor was thereany one at home--the old man was dead!In the evening there was a hearse seen before the door, and he was borne intoit in his coffin: he was now to go out into the country, to lie in his grave.He was driven out there, but no one followed; all his friends were dead, andthe little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as it was driven away.Some days afterwards there was an auction at the old house, and the little boysaw from his window how they carried the old knights and the old ladies away,the flower-pots with the long ears, the old chairs, and the oldclothes-presses. Something came here, and something came there; the portraitof her who had been found at the broker's came to the broker's again; andthere it hung, for no one knew her more--no one cared about the old picture.In the spring they pulled the house down, for, as people said, it was a ruin.One could see from the street right into the room with the hog's-leatherhanging, which was slashed and torn; and the green grass and leaves about thebalcony hung quite wild about the falling beams. And then it was put torights."That was a relief," said the neighboring houses.A fine house was built there, with large windows, and smooth white walls; butbefore it, where the old house had in fact stood, was a little garden laidout, and a wild grapevine ran up the wall of the neighboring house. Before thegarden there was a large iron railing with an iron door, it looked quitesplendid, and people stood still and peeped in, and the sparrows hung byscores in the vine, and chattered away at each other as well as they could,but it was not about the old house, for they could not remember it, so manyyears had passed--so many that the little boy had grown up to a whole man,yes, a clever man, and a pleasure to his parents; and he had just beenmarried, and, together with his little wife, had come to live in the househere, where the garden was; and he stood by her there whilst she planted afield-flower that she found so pretty; she planted it with her little hand,and pressed the earth around it with her fingers. Oh! what was that? She hadstuck herself. There sat something pointed, straight out of the soft mould.It was--yes, guess! It was the pewter soldier, he that was lost up at the oldman's, and had tumbled and turned about amongst the timber and the rubbish,and had at last laid for many years in the ground.The young wife wiped the dirt off the soldier, first with a green leaf, andthen with her fine handkerchief--it had such a delightful smell, that it wasto the pewter soldier just as if he had awaked from a trance."Let me see him," said the young man. He laughed, and then shook his head."Nay, it cannot be he; but he reminds me of a story about a pewter soldierwhich I had when I was a little boy!" And then he told his wife about the oldhouse, and the old man, and about the pewter soldier that he sent over to himbecause he was so very, very lonely; and he told it as correctly as it hadreally been, so that the tears came into the eyes of his young wife, onaccount of the old house and the old man."It may possibly be, however, that it is the same pewter soldier!" said she."I will take care of it, and remember all that you have told me; but you mustshow me the old man's grave!""But I do not know it," said he, "and no one knows it!

He laughed, and then shook his head."Nay, it cannot be he; but he reminds me of a story about a pewter soldierwhich I had when I was a little boy!" And then he told his wife about the oldhouse, and the old man, and about the pewter soldier that he sent over to himbecause he was so very, very lonely; and he told it as correctly as it hadreally been, so that the tears came into the eyes of his young wife, onaccount of the old house and the old man."It may possibly be, however, that it is the same pewter soldier!" said she."I will take care of it, and remember all that you have told me; but you mustshow me the old man's grave!""But I do not know it," said he, "and no one knows it! All his friends weredead, no one took care of it, and I was then a little boy!""How very, very lonely he must have been!" said she."Very, very lonely!" said the pewter soldier. "But it is delightful not to beforgotten!""Delightful!" shouted something close by; but no one, except the pewtersoldier, saw that it was a piece of the hog's-leather hangings; it had lostall its gilding, it looked like a piece of wet clay, but it had an opinion,and it gave it:"The gilding decays,But hog's leather stays!"This the pewter soldier did not believe.8.2 Add  The Old House to your library.Return to the Hans Christian Andersen library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Princess and the Pea "I thank you for the pewter soldier, my little friend!" said the old man. "AndI thank you because you come over to me.""Thankee! thankee!" or "cranky! cranky!" sounded from all the furniture; therewas so much of it, that each article stood in the other's way, to get a lookat the little boy.In the middle of the wall hung a picture representing a beautiful lady, soyoung, so glad, but dressed quite as in former times, with clothes that stoodquite stiff, and with powder in her hair; she neither said "thankee, thankee!"nor "cranky, cranky!" but looked with her mild eyes at the little boy, whodirectly asked the old man, "Where did you get her?""Yonder, at the broker's," said the old man, "where there are so many pictureshanging. No one knows or cares about them, for they are all of them buried;but I knew her in by-gone days, and now she has been dead and gone these fiftyyears!"Under the picture, in a glazed frame, there hung a bouquet of witheredflowers; they were almost fifty years old; they looked so very old!The pendulum of the great clock went to and fro, and the hands turned, andeverything in the room became still older; but they did not observe it."They say at home," said the little boy, "that you are so very, very lonely!""Oh!" said he. "The old thoughts, with what they may bring with them, come andvisit me, and now you also come! I am very well off!"Then he took a book with pictures in it down from the shelf; there werewhole long processions and pageants, with the strangest characters, which onenever sees now-a-days; soldiers like the knave of clubs, and citizens withwaving flags: the tailors had theirs, with a pair of shears held by twolions--and the shoemakers theirs, without boots, but with an eagle that hadtwo heads, for the shoemakers must have everything so that they can say, it isa pair! Yes, that was a picture book!The old man now went into the other room to fetch preserves, apples, andnuts--yes, it was delightful over there in the old house."I cannot bear it any longer!" said the pewter soldier, who sat on thedrawers. "It is so lonely and melancholy here! But when one has been in afamily circle one cannot accustom oneself to this life! I cannot bear it anylonger! The whole day is so long, and the evenings are still longer! Here itis not at all as it is over the way at your home, where your father andmother spoke so pleasantly, and where you and all your sweet children madesuch a delightful noise. Nay, how lonely the old man is--do you think that hegets kisses? Do you think he gets mild eyes, or a Christmas tree? He will getnothing but a grave! I can bear it no longer!""You must not let it grieve you so much," said the little boy. "I find it sovery delightful here, and then all the old thoughts, with what they may bringwith them, they come and visit here.""Yes, it's all very well, but I see nothing of them, and I don't know them!"said the pewter soldier. "I cannot bear it!""But you must!" said the little boy.Then in came the old man with the most pleased and happy face, the mostdelicious preserves, apples, and nuts, and so the little boy thought no moreabout the pewter soldier.The little boy returned home happy and pleased, and weeks and days passedaway, and nods were made to the old house, and from the old house, and thenthe little boy went over there again.The carved trumpeters blew, "Trateratra! There is the little boy! Trateratra!"and the swords and armor on the knights' portraits rattled, and the silk gownsrustled; the hog's leather spoke, and the old chairs had the gout in theirlegs and rheumatism in their backs: Ugh! it was exactly like the first time,for over there one day and hour was just like another."I cannot bear it!" said the pewter soldier. "I have shed pewter tears! It istoo melancholy! Rather let me go to the wars and lose arms and legs! It wouldat least be a change. I cannot bear it longer! Now, I know what it is to havea visit from one's old thoughts, with what they may bring with them! I havehad a visit from mine, and you may be sure it is no pleasant thing in the end;I was at last about to jump down from the drawers."I saw you all over there at home so distinctly, as if you really were here;it was again that Sunday morning; all you children stood before the table andsung your Psalms, as you do every morning. You stood devoutly with foldedhands; and father and mother were just as pious; and then the door was opened,and little sister Mary, who is not two years old yet, and who always danceswhen she hears music or singing, of whatever kind it may be, was put into theroom--though she ought not to have been there--and then she began to dance,but could not keep time, because the tones were so long; and then she stood,first on the one leg, and bent her head forwards, and then on the other leg,and bent her head forwards--but all would not do. You stood very seriously alltogether, although it was difficult enough; but I laughed to myself, and thenI fell off the table, and got a bump, which I have still--for it was notright of me to laugh. But the whole now passes before me again in thought, andeverything that I have lived to see; and these are the old thoughts, with whatthey may bring with them."Tell me if you still sing on Sundays? Tell me something about little Mary!And how my comrade, the other pewter soldier, lives! Yes, he is happy enough,that's sure! I cannot bear it any longer!""You are given away as a present!" said the little boy. "You must remain. Canyou not understand that?"The old man now came with a drawer, in which there was much to be seen, both"tin boxes" and "balsam boxes," old cards, so large and so gilded, such as onenever sees them now. And several drawers were opened, and the piano wasopened; it had landscapes on the inside of the lid, and it was so hoarse whenthe old man played on it! and then he hummed a song."Yes, she could sing that!" said he, and nodded to the portrait, which hehad bought at the broker's, and the old man's eyes shone so bright!"I will go to the wars! I will go to the wars!" shouted the pewter soldier asloud as he could, and threw himself off the drawers right down on the floor.What became of him? The old man sought, and the little boy sought; he wasaway, and he stayed away."I shall find him!" said the old man; but he never found him. The floor wastoo open--the pewter soldier had fallen through a crevice, and there he lay asin an open tomb.That day passed, and the little boy went home, and that week passed, andseveral weeks too. The windows were quite frozen, the little boy was obligedto sit and breathe on them to get a peep-hole over to the old house, and therethe snow had been blown into all the carved work and inscriptions; it layquite up over the steps, just as if there was no one at home--nor was thereany one at home--the old man was dead!In the evening there was a hearse seen before the door, and he was borne intoit in his coffin: he was now to go out into the country, to lie in his grave.He was driven out there, but no one followed; all his friends were dead, andthe little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as it was driven away.Some days afterwards there was an auction at the old house, and the little boysaw from his window how they carried the old knights and the old ladies away,the flower-pots with the long ears, the old chairs, and the oldclothes-presses. Something came here, and something came there; the portraitof her who had been found at the broker's came to the broker's again; andthere it hung, for no one knew her more--no one cared about the old picture.In the spring they pulled the house down, for, as people said, it was a ruin.One could see from the street right into the room with the hog's-leatherhanging, which was slashed and torn; and the green grass and leaves about thebalcony hung quite wild about the falling beams. And then it was put torights."That was a relief," said the neighboring houses.A fine house was built there, with large windows, and smooth white walls; butbefore it, where the old house had in fact stood, was a little garden laidout, and a wild grapevine ran up the wall of the neighboring house. Before thegarden there was a large iron railing with an iron door, it looked quitesplendid, and people stood still and peeped in, and the sparrows hung byscores in the vine, and chattered away at each other as well as they could,but it was not about the old house, for they could not remember it, so manyyears had passed--so many that the little boy had grown up to a whole man,yes, a clever man, and a pleasure to his parents; and he had just beenmarried, and, together with his little wife, had come to live in the househere, where the garden was; and he stood by her there whilst she planted afield-flower that she found so pretty; she planted it with her little hand,and pressed the earth around it with her fingers. Oh! what was that? She hadstuck herself. There sat something pointed, straight out of the soft mould.It was--yes, guess! It was the pewter soldier, he that was lost up at the oldman's, and had tumbled and turned about amongst the timber and the rubbish,and had at last laid for many years in the ground.The young wife wiped the dirt off the soldier, first with a green leaf, andthen with her fine handkerchief--it had such a delightful smell, that it wasto the pewter soldier just as if he had awaked from a trance."Let me see him," said the young man.

And then he told his wife about the oldhouse, and the old man, and about the pewter soldier that he sent over to himbecause he was so very, very lonely; and he told it as correctly as it hadreally been, so that the tears came into the eyes of his young wife, onaccount of the old house and the old man."It may possibly be, however, that it is the same pewter soldier!" said she."I will take care of it, and remember all that you have told me; but you mustshow me the old man's grave!""But I do not know it," said he, "and no one knows it! All his friends weredead, no one took care of it, and I was then a little boy!""How very, very lonely he must have been!" said she."Very, very lonely!" said the pewter soldier. "But it is delightful not to beforgotten!""Delightful!" shouted something close by; but no one, except the pewtersoldier, saw that it was a piece of the hog's-leather hangings; it had lostall its gilding, it looked like a piece of wet clay, but it had an opinion,and it gave it:"The gilding decays,But hog's leather stays!"This the pewter soldier did not believe.8.2 Add  The Old House to your library.Return to the Hans Christian Andersen library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Princess and the Pea "Yonder, at the broker's," said the old man, "where there are so many pictureshanging. No one knows or cares about them, for they are all of them buried;but I knew her in by-gone days, and now she has been dead and gone these fiftyyears!"Under the picture, in a glazed frame, there hung a bouquet of witheredflowers; they were almost fifty years old; they looked so very old!The pendulum of the great clock went to and fro, and the hands turned, andeverything in the room became still older; but they did not observe it."They say at home," said the little boy, "that you are so very, very lonely!""Oh!" said he. "The old thoughts, with what they may bring with them, come andvisit me, and now you also come! I am very well off!"Then he took a book with pictures in it down from the shelf; there werewhole long processions and pageants, with the strangest characters, which onenever sees now-a-days; soldiers like the knave of clubs, and citizens withwaving flags: the tailors had theirs, with a pair of shears held by twolions--and the shoemakers theirs, without boots, but with an eagle that hadtwo heads, for the shoemakers must have everything so that they can say, it isa pair! Yes, that was a picture book!The old man now went into the other room to fetch preserves, apples, andnuts--yes, it was delightful over there in the old house."I cannot bear it any longer!" said the pewter soldier, who sat on thedrawers. "It is so lonely and melancholy here! But when one has been in afamily circle one cannot accustom oneself to this life! I cannot bear it anylonger! The whole day is so long, and the evenings are still longer! Here itis not at all as it is over the way at your home, where your father andmother spoke so pleasantly, and where you and all your sweet children madesuch a delightful noise. Nay, how lonely the old man is--do you think that hegets kisses? Do you think he gets mild eyes, or a Christmas tree? He will getnothing but a grave! I can bear it no longer!""You must not let it grieve you so much," said the little boy. "I find it sovery delightful here, and then all the old thoughts, with what they may bringwith them, they come and visit here.""Yes, it's all very well, but I see nothing of them, and I don't know them!"said the pewter soldier. "I cannot bear it!""But you must!" said the little boy.Then in came the old man with the most pleased and happy face, the mostdelicious preserves, apples, and nuts, and so the little boy thought no moreabout the pewter soldier.The little boy returned home happy and pleased, and weeks and days passedaway, and nods were made to the old house, and from the old house, and thenthe little boy went over there again.The carved trumpeters blew, "Trateratra! There is the little boy! Trateratra!"and the swords and armor on the knights' portraits rattled, and the silk gownsrustled; the hog's leather spoke, and the old chairs had the gout in theirlegs and rheumatism in their backs: Ugh! it was exactly like the first time,for over there one day and hour was just like another."I cannot bear it!" said the pewter soldier. "I have shed pewter tears! It istoo melancholy! Rather let me go to the wars and lose arms and legs! It wouldat least be a change. I cannot bear it longer! Now, I know what it is to havea visit from one's old thoughts, with what they may bring with them! I havehad a visit from mine, and you may be sure it is no pleasant thing in the end;I was at last about to jump down from the drawers."I saw you all over there at home so distinctly, as if you really were here;it was again that Sunday morning; all you children stood before the table andsung your Psalms, as you do every morning. You stood devoutly with foldedhands; and father and mother were just as pious; and then the door was opened,and little sister Mary, who is not two years old yet, and who always danceswhen she hears music or singing, of whatever kind it may be, was put into theroom--though she ought not to have been there--and then she began to dance,but could not keep time, because the tones were so long; and then she stood,first on the one leg, and bent her head forwards, and then on the other leg,and bent her head forwards--but all would not do. You stood very seriously alltogether, although it was difficult enough; but I laughed to myself, and thenI fell off the table, and got a bump, which I have still--for it was notright of me to laugh. But the whole now passes before me again in thought, andeverything that I have lived to see; and these are the old thoughts, with whatthey may bring with them."Tell me if you still sing on Sundays? Tell me something about little Mary!And how my comrade, the other pewter soldier, lives! Yes, he is happy enough,that's sure! I cannot bear it any longer!""You are given away as a present!" said the little boy. "You must remain. Canyou not understand that?"The old man now came with a drawer, in which there was much to be seen, both"tin boxes" and "balsam boxes," old cards, so large and so gilded, such as onenever sees them now. And several drawers were opened, and the piano wasopened; it had landscapes on the inside of the lid, and it was so hoarse whenthe old man played on it! and then he hummed a song."Yes, she could sing that!" said he, and nodded to the portrait, which hehad bought at the broker's, and the old man's eyes shone so bright!"I will go to the wars! I will go to the wars!" shouted the pewter soldier asloud as he could, and threw himself off the drawers right down on the floor.What became of him? The old man sought, and the little boy sought; he wasaway, and he stayed away."I shall find him!" said the old man; but he never found him. The floor wastoo open--the pewter soldier had fallen through a crevice, and there he lay asin an open tomb.That day passed, and the little boy went home, and that week passed, andseveral weeks too. The windows were quite frozen, the little boy was obligedto sit and breathe on them to get a peep-hole over to the old house, and therethe snow had been blown into all the carved work and inscriptions; it layquite up over the steps, just as if there was no one at home--nor was thereany one at home--the old man was dead!In the evening there was a hearse seen before the door, and he was borne intoit in his coffin: he was now to go out into the country, to lie in his grave.He was driven out there, but no one followed; all his friends were dead, andthe little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as it was driven away.Some days afterwards there was an auction at the old house, and the little boysaw from his window how they carried the old knights and the old ladies away,the flower-pots with the long ears, the old chairs, and the oldclothes-presses. Something came here, and something came there; the portraitof her who had been found at the broker's came to the broker's again; andthere it hung, for no one knew her more--no one cared about the old picture.In the spring they pulled the house down, for, as people said, it was a ruin.One could see from the street right into the room with the hog's-leatherhanging, which was slashed and torn; and the green grass and leaves about thebalcony hung quite wild about the falling beams. And then it was put torights."That was a relief," said the neighboring houses.A fine house was built there, with large windows, and smooth white walls; butbefore it, where the old house had in fact stood, was a little garden laidout, and a wild grapevine ran up the wall of the neighboring house. Before thegarden there was a large iron railing with an iron door, it looked quitesplendid, and people stood still and peeped in, and the sparrows hung byscores in the vine, and chattered away at each other as well as they could,but it was not about the old house, for they could not remember it, so manyyears had passed--so many that the little boy had grown up to a whole man,yes, a clever man, and a pleasure to his parents; and he had just beenmarried, and, together with his little wife, had come to live in the househere, where the garden was; and he stood by her there whilst she planted afield-flower that she found so pretty; she planted it with her little hand,and pressed the earth around it with her fingers. Oh! what was that? She hadstuck herself. There sat something pointed, straight out of the soft mould.It was--yes, guess! It was the pewter soldier, he that was lost up at the oldman's, and had tumbled and turned about amongst the timber and the rubbish,and had at last laid for many years in the ground.The young wife wiped the dirt off the soldier, first with a green leaf, andthen with her fine handkerchief--it had such a delightful smell, that it wasto the pewter soldier just as if he had awaked from a trance."Let me see him," said the young man.

Nay, how lonely the old man is--do you think that hegets kisses? Do you think he gets mild eyes, or a Christmas tree? He will getnothing but a grave! I can bear it no longer!""You must not let it grieve you so much," said the little boy. "I find it sovery delightful here, and then all the old thoughts, with what they may bringwith them, they come and visit here.""Yes, it's all very well, but I see nothing of them, and I don't know them!"said the pewter soldier. "I cannot bear it!""But you must!" said the little boy.Then in came the old man with the most pleased and happy face, the mostdelicious preserves, apples, and nuts, and so the little boy thought no moreabout the pewter soldier.The little boy returned home happy and pleased, and weeks and days passedaway, and nods were made to the old house, and from the old house, and thenthe little boy went over there again.The carved trumpeters blew, "Trateratra! There is the little boy! Trateratra!"and the swords and armor on the knights' portraits rattled, and the silk gownsrustled; the hog's leather spoke, and the old chairs had the gout in theirlegs and rheumatism in their backs: Ugh! it was exactly like the first time,for over there one day and hour was just like another."I cannot bear it!" said the pewter soldier. "I have shed pewter tears! It istoo melancholy! Rather let me go to the wars and lose arms and legs! It wouldat least be a change. I cannot bear it longer! Now, I know what it is to havea visit from one's old thoughts, with what they may bring with them! I havehad a visit from mine, and you may be sure it is no pleasant thing in the end;I was at last about to jump down from the drawers."I saw you all over there at home so distinctly, as if you really were here;it was again that Sunday morning; all you children stood before the table andsung your Psalms, as you do every morning. You stood devoutly with foldedhands; and father and mother were just as pious; and then the door was opened,and little sister Mary, who is not two years old yet, and who always danceswhen she hears music or singing, of whatever kind it may be, was put into theroom--though she ought not to have been there--and then she began to dance,but could not keep time, because the tones were so long; and then she stood,first on the one leg, and bent her head forwards, and then on the other leg,and bent her head forwards--but all would not do. You stood very seriously alltogether, although it was difficult enough; but I laughed to myself, and thenI fell off the table, and got a bump, which I have still--for it was notright of me to laugh. But the whole now passes before me again in thought, andeverything that I have lived to see; and these are the old thoughts, with whatthey may bring with them."Tell me if you still sing on Sundays? Tell me something about little Mary!And how my comrade, the other pewter soldier, lives! Yes, he is happy enough,that's sure! I cannot bear it any longer!""You are given away as a present!" said the little boy. "You must remain. Canyou not understand that?"The old man now came with a drawer, in which there was much to be seen, both"tin boxes" and "balsam boxes," old cards, so large and so gilded, such as onenever sees them now. And several drawers were opened, and the piano wasopened; it had landscapes on the inside of the lid, and it was so hoarse whenthe old man played on it! and then he hummed a song."Yes, she could sing that!" said he, and nodded to the portrait, which hehad bought at the broker's, and the old man's eyes shone so bright!"I will go to the wars! I will go to the wars!" shouted the pewter soldier asloud as he could, and threw himself off the drawers right down on the floor.What became of him? The old man sought, and the little boy sought; he wasaway, and he stayed away."I shall find him!" said the old man; but he never found him. The floor wastoo open--the pewter soldier had fallen through a crevice, and there he lay asin an open tomb.That day passed, and the little boy went home, and that week passed, andseveral weeks too. The windows were quite frozen, the little boy was obligedto sit and breathe on them to get a peep-hole over to the old house, and therethe snow had been blown into all the carved work and inscriptions; it layquite up over the steps, just as if there was no one at home--nor was thereany one at home--the old man was dead!In the evening there was a hearse seen before the door, and he was borne intoit in his coffin: he was now to go out into the country, to lie in his grave.He was driven out there, but no one followed; all his friends were dead, andthe little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as it was driven away.Some days afterwards there was an auction at the old house, and the little boysaw from his window how they carried the old knights and the old ladies away,the flower-pots with the long ears, the old chairs, and the oldclothes-presses. Something came here, and something came there; the portraitof her who had been found at the broker's came to the broker's again; andthere it hung, for no one knew her more--no one cared about the old picture.In the spring they pulled the house down, for, as people said, it was a ruin.One could see from the street right into the room with the hog's-leatherhanging, which was slashed and torn; and the green grass and leaves about thebalcony hung quite wild about the falling beams. And then it was put torights."That was a relief," said the neighboring houses.A fine house was built there, with large windows, and smooth white walls; butbefore it, where the old house had in fact stood, was a little garden laidout, and a wild grapevine ran up the wall of the neighboring house. Before thegarden there was a large iron railing with an iron door, it looked quitesplendid, and people stood still and peeped in, and the sparrows hung byscores in the vine, and chattered away at each other as well as they could,but it was not about the old house, for they could not remember it, so manyyears had passed--so many that the little boy had grown up to a whole man,yes, a clever man, and a pleasure to his parents; and he had just beenmarried, and, together with his little wife, had come to live in the househere, where the garden was; and he stood by her there whilst she planted afield-flower that she found so pretty; she planted it with her little hand,and pressed the earth around it with her fingers. Oh! what was that? She hadstuck herself. There sat something pointed, straight out of the soft mould.It was--yes, guess! It was the pewter soldier, he that was lost up at the oldman's, and had tumbled and turned about amongst the timber and the rubbish,and had at last laid for many years in the ground.The young wife wiped the dirt off the soldier, first with a green leaf, andthen with her fine handkerchief--it had such a delightful smell, that it wasto the pewter soldier just as if he had awaked from a trance."Let me see him," said the young man. He laughed, and then shook his head."Nay, it cannot be he; but he reminds me of a story about a pewter soldierwhich I had when I was a little boy!" And then he told his wife about the oldhouse, and the old man, and about the pewter soldier that he sent over to himbecause he was so very, very lonely; and he told it as correctly as it hadreally been, so that the tears came into the eyes of his young wife, onaccount of the old house and the old man."It may possibly be, however, that it is the same pewter soldier!" said she."I will take care of it, and remember all that you have told me; but you mustshow me the old man's grave!""But I do not know it," said he, "and no one knows it! All his friends weredead, no one took care of it, and I was then a little boy!""How very, very lonely he must have been!" said she."Very, very lonely!" said the pewter soldier. "But it is delightful not to beforgotten!""Delightful!" shouted something close by; but no one, except the pewtersoldier, saw that it was a piece of the hog's-leather hangings; it had lostall its gilding, it looked like a piece of wet clay, but it had an opinion,and it gave it:"The gilding decays,But hog's leather stays!"This the pewter soldier did not believe.8.2 Add  The Old House to your library.Return to the Hans Christian Andersen library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Princess and the Pea "Oh!" said he. "The old thoughts, with what they may bring with them, come andvisit me, and now you also come! I am very well off!"Then he took a book with pictures in it down from the shelf; there werewhole long processions and pageants, with the strangest characters, which onenever sees now-a-days; soldiers like the knave of clubs, and citizens withwaving flags: the tailors had theirs, with a pair of shears held by twolions--and the shoemakers theirs, without boots, but with an eagle that hadtwo heads, for the shoemakers must have everything so that they can say, it isa pair! Yes, that was a picture book!The old man now went into the other room to fetch preserves, apples, andnuts--yes, it was delightful over there in the old house."I cannot bear it any longer!" said the pewter soldier, who sat on thedrawers. "It is so lonely and melancholy here! But when one has been in afamily circle one cannot accustom oneself to this life! I cannot bear it anylonger! The whole day is so long, and the evenings are still longer! Here itis not at all as it is over the way at your home, where your father andmother spoke so pleasantly, and where you and all your sweet children madesuch a delightful noise.

Something came here, and something came there; the portraitof her who had been found at the broker's came to the broker's again; andthere it hung, for no one knew her more--no one cared about the old picture.In the spring they pulled the house down, for, as people said, it was a ruin.One could see from the street right into the room with the hog's-leatherhanging, which was slashed and torn; and the green grass and leaves about thebalcony hung quite wild about the falling beams. And then it was put torights."That was a relief," said the neighboring houses.A fine house was built there, with large windows, and smooth white walls; butbefore it, where the old house had in fact stood, was a little garden laidout, and a wild grapevine ran up the wall of the neighboring house. Before thegarden there was a large iron railing with an iron door, it looked quitesplendid, and people stood still and peeped in, and the sparrows hung byscores in the vine, and chattered away at each other as well as they could,but it was not about the old house, for they could not remember it, so manyyears had passed--so many that the little boy had grown up to a whole man,yes, a clever man, and a pleasure to his parents; and he had just beenmarried, and, together with his little wife, had come to live in the househere, where the garden was; and he stood by her there whilst she planted afield-flower that she found so pretty; she planted it with her little hand,and pressed the earth around it with her fingers. Oh! what was that? She hadstuck herself. There sat something pointed, straight out of the soft mould.It was--yes, guess! It was the pewter soldier, he that was lost up at the oldman's, and had tumbled and turned about amongst the timber and the rubbish,and had at last laid for many years in the ground.The young wife wiped the dirt off the soldier, first with a green leaf, andthen with her fine handkerchief--it had such a delightful smell, that it wasto the pewter soldier just as if he had awaked from a trance."Let me see him," said the young man. He laughed, and then shook his head."Nay, it cannot be he; but he reminds me of a story about a pewter soldierwhich I had when I was a little boy!" And then he told his wife about the oldhouse, and the old man, and about the pewter soldier that he sent over to himbecause he was so very, very lonely; and he told it as correctly as it hadreally been, so that the tears came into the eyes of his young wife, onaccount of the old house and the old man."It may possibly be, however, that it is the same pewter soldier!" said she."I will take care of it, and remember all that you have told me; but you mustshow me the old man's grave!""But I do not know it," said he, "and no one knows it! All his friends weredead, no one took care of it, and I was then a little boy!""How very, very lonely he must have been!" said she."Very, very lonely!" said the pewter soldier. "But it is delightful not to beforgotten!""Delightful!" shouted something close by; but no one, except the pewtersoldier, saw that it was a piece of the hog's-leather hangings; it had lostall its gilding, it looked like a piece of wet clay, but it had an opinion,and it gave it:"The gilding decays,But hog's leather stays!"This the pewter soldier did not believe.8.2 Add  The Old House to your library.Return to the Hans Christian Andersen library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Princess and the Pea "I cannot bear it any longer!" said the pewter soldier, who sat on thedrawers. "It is so lonely and melancholy here! But when one has been in afamily circle one cannot accustom oneself to this life! I cannot bear it anylonger! The whole day is so long, and the evenings are still longer! Here itis not at all as it is over the way at your home, where your father andmother spoke so pleasantly, and where you and all your sweet children madesuch a delightful noise. Nay, how lonely the old man is--do you think that hegets kisses? Do you think he gets mild eyes, or a Christmas tree? He will getnothing but a grave! I can bear it no longer!""You must not let it grieve you so much," said the little boy. "I find it sovery delightful here, and then all the old thoughts, with what they may bringwith them, they come and visit here.""Yes, it's all very well, but I see nothing of them, and I don't know them!"said the pewter soldier. "I cannot bear it!""But you must!" said the little boy.Then in came the old man with the most pleased and happy face, the mostdelicious preserves, apples, and nuts, and so the little boy thought no moreabout the pewter soldier.The little boy returned home happy and pleased, and weeks and days passedaway, and nods were made to the old house, and from the old house, and thenthe little boy went over there again.The carved trumpeters blew, "Trateratra! There is the little boy! Trateratra!"and the swords and armor on the knights' portraits rattled, and the silk gownsrustled; the hog's leather spoke, and the old chairs had the gout in theirlegs and rheumatism in their backs: Ugh! it was exactly like the first time,for over there one day and hour was just like another."I cannot bear it!" said the pewter soldier. "I have shed pewter tears! It istoo melancholy! Rather let me go to the wars and lose arms and legs! It wouldat least be a change. I cannot bear it longer! Now, I know what it is to havea visit from one's old thoughts, with what they may bring with them! I havehad a visit from mine, and you may be sure it is no pleasant thing in the end;I was at last about to jump down from the drawers."I saw you all over there at home so distinctly, as if you really were here;it was again that Sunday morning; all you children stood before the table andsung your Psalms, as you do every morning. You stood devoutly with foldedhands; and father and mother were just as pious; and then the door was opened,and little sister Mary, who is not two years old yet, and who always danceswhen she hears music or singing, of whatever kind it may be, was put into theroom--though she ought not to have been there--and then she began to dance,but could not keep time, because the tones were so long; and then she stood,first on the one leg, and bent her head forwards, and then on the other leg,and bent her head forwards--but all would not do. You stood very seriously alltogether, although it was difficult enough; but I laughed to myself, and thenI fell off the table, and got a bump, which I have still--for it was notright of me to laugh. But the whole now passes before me again in thought, andeverything that I have lived to see; and these are the old thoughts, with whatthey may bring with them."Tell me if you still sing on Sundays? Tell me something about little Mary!And how my comrade, the other pewter soldier, lives! Yes, he is happy enough,that's sure! I cannot bear it any longer!""You are given away as a present!" said the little boy. "You must remain. Canyou not understand that?"The old man now came with a drawer, in which there was much to be seen, both"tin boxes" and "balsam boxes," old cards, so large and so gilded, such as onenever sees them now. And several drawers were opened, and the piano wasopened; it had landscapes on the inside of the lid, and it was so hoarse whenthe old man played on it! and then he hummed a song."Yes, she could sing that!" said he, and nodded to the portrait, which hehad bought at the broker's, and the old man's eyes shone so bright!"I will go to the wars! I will go to the wars!" shouted the pewter soldier asloud as he could, and threw himself off the drawers right down on the floor.What became of him? The old man sought, and the little boy sought; he wasaway, and he stayed away."I shall find him!" said the old man; but he never found him. The floor wastoo open--the pewter soldier had fallen through a crevice, and there he lay asin an open tomb.That day passed, and the little boy went home, and that week passed, andseveral weeks too.

The windows were quite frozen, the little boy was obligedto sit and breathe on them to get a peep-hole over to the old house, and therethe snow had been blown into all the carved work and inscriptions; it layquite up over the steps, just as if there was no one at home--nor was thereany one at home--the old man was dead!In the evening there was a hearse seen before the door, and he was borne intoit in his coffin: he was now to go out into the country, to lie in his grave.He was driven out there, but no one followed; all his friends were dead, andthe little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as it was driven away.Some days afterwards there was an auction at the old house, and the little boysaw from his window how they carried the old knights and the old ladies away,the flower-pots with the long ears, the old chairs, and the oldclothes-presses. Something came here, and something came there; the portraitof her who had been found at the broker's came to the broker's again; andthere it hung, for no one knew her more--no one cared about the old picture.In the spring they pulled the house down, for, as people said, it was a ruin.One could see from the street right into the room with the hog's-leatherhanging, which was slashed and torn; and the green grass and leaves about thebalcony hung quite wild about the falling beams. And then it was put torights."That was a relief," said the neighboring houses.A fine house was built there, with large windows, and smooth white walls; butbefore it, where the old house had in fact stood, was a little garden laidout, and a wild grapevine ran up the wall of the neighboring house. Before thegarden there was a large iron railing with an iron door, it looked quitesplendid, and people stood still and peeped in, and the sparrows hung byscores in the vine, and chattered away at each other as well as they could,but it was not about the old house, for they could not remember it, so manyyears had passed--so many that the little boy had grown up to a whole man,yes, a clever man, and a pleasure to his parents; and he had just beenmarried, and, together with his little wife, had come to live in the househere, where the garden was; and he stood by her there whilst she planted afield-flower that she found so pretty; she planted it with her little hand,and pressed the earth around it with her fingers. Oh! what was that? She hadstuck herself. There sat something pointed, straight out of the soft mould.It was--yes, guess! It was the pewter soldier, he that was lost up at the oldman's, and had tumbled and turned about amongst the timber and the rubbish,and had at last laid for many years in the ground.The young wife wiped the dirt off the soldier, first with a green leaf, andthen with her fine handkerchief--it had such a delightful smell, that it wasto the pewter soldier just as if he had awaked from a trance."Let me see him," said the young man. He laughed, and then shook his head."Nay, it cannot be he; but he reminds me of a story about a pewter soldierwhich I had when I was a little boy!" And then he told his wife about the oldhouse, and the old man, and about the pewter soldier that he sent over to himbecause he was so very, very lonely; and he told it as correctly as it hadreally been, so that the tears came into the eyes of his young wife, onaccount of the old house and the old man."It may possibly be, however, that it is the same pewter soldier!" said she."I will take care of it, and remember all that you have told me; but you mustshow me the old man's grave!""But I do not know it," said he, "and no one knows it! All his friends weredead, no one took care of it, and I was then a little boy!""How very, very lonely he must have been!" said she."Very, very lonely!" said the pewter soldier. "But it is delightful not to beforgotten!""Delightful!" shouted something close by; but no one, except the pewtersoldier, saw that it was a piece of the hog's-leather hangings; it had lostall its gilding, it looked like a piece of wet clay, but it had an opinion,and it gave it:"The gilding decays,But hog's leather stays!"This the pewter soldier did not believe.8.2 Add  The Old House to your library.Return to the Hans Christian Andersen library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Princess and the Pea Then in came the old man with the most pleased and happy face, the mostdelicious preserves, apples, and nuts, and so the little boy thought no moreabout the pewter soldier.The little boy returned home happy and pleased, and weeks and days passedaway, and nods were made to the old house, and from the old house, and thenthe little boy went over there again.The carved trumpeters blew, "Trateratra! There is the little boy! Trateratra!"and the swords and armor on the knights' portraits rattled, and the silk gownsrustled; the hog's leather spoke, and the old chairs had the gout in theirlegs and rheumatism in their backs: Ugh! it was exactly like the first time,for over there one day and hour was just like another."I cannot bear it!" said the pewter soldier. "I have shed pewter tears! It istoo melancholy! Rather let me go to the wars and lose arms and legs! It wouldat least be a change. I cannot bear it longer! Now, I know what it is to havea visit from one's old thoughts, with what they may bring with them! I havehad a visit from mine, and you may be sure it is no pleasant thing in the end;I was at last about to jump down from the drawers."I saw you all over there at home so distinctly, as if you really were here;it was again that Sunday morning; all you children stood before the table andsung your Psalms, as you do every morning. You stood devoutly with foldedhands; and father and mother were just as pious; and then the door was opened,and little sister Mary, who is not two years old yet, and who always danceswhen she hears music or singing, of whatever kind it may be, was put into theroom--though she ought not to have been there--and then she began to dance,but could not keep time, because the tones were so long; and then she stood,first on the one leg, and bent her head forwards, and then on the other leg,and bent her head forwards--but all would not do. You stood very seriously alltogether, although it was difficult enough; but I laughed to myself, and thenI fell off the table, and got a bump, which I have still--for it was notright of me to laugh. But the whole now passes before me again in thought, andeverything that I have lived to see; and these are the old thoughts, with whatthey may bring with them."Tell me if you still sing on Sundays? Tell me something about little Mary!And how my comrade, the other pewter soldier, lives! Yes, he is happy enough,that's sure! I cannot bear it any longer!""You are given away as a present!" said the little boy. "You must remain. Canyou not understand that?"The old man now came with a drawer, in which there was much to be seen, both"tin boxes" and "balsam boxes," old cards, so large and so gilded, such as onenever sees them now. And several drawers were opened, and the piano wasopened; it had landscapes on the inside of the lid, and it was so hoarse whenthe old man played on it! and then he hummed a song."Yes, she could sing that!" said he, and nodded to the portrait, which hehad bought at the broker's, and the old man's eyes shone so bright!"I will go to the wars! I will go to the wars!" shouted the pewter soldier asloud as he could, and threw himself off the drawers right down on the floor.What became of him?

It was the pewter soldier, he that was lost up at the oldman's, and had tumbled and turned about amongst the timber and the rubbish,and had at last laid for many years in the ground.The young wife wiped the dirt off the soldier, first with a green leaf, andthen with her fine handkerchief--it had such a delightful smell, that it wasto the pewter soldier just as if he had awaked from a trance."Let me see him," said the young man. He laughed, and then shook his head."Nay, it cannot be he; but he reminds me of a story about a pewter soldierwhich I had when I was a little boy!" And then he told his wife about the oldhouse, and the old man, and about the pewter soldier that he sent over to himbecause he was so very, very lonely; and he told it as correctly as it hadreally been, so that the tears came into the eyes of his young wife, onaccount of the old house and the old man."It may possibly be, however, that it is the same pewter soldier!" said she."I will take care of it, and remember all that you have told me; but you mustshow me the old man's grave!""But I do not know it," said he, "and no one knows it! All his friends weredead, no one took care of it, and I was then a little boy!""How very, very lonely he must have been!" said she."Very, very lonely!" said the pewter soldier. "But it is delightful not to beforgotten!""Delightful!" shouted something close by; but no one, except the pewtersoldier, saw that it was a piece of the hog's-leather hangings; it had lostall its gilding, it looked like a piece of wet clay, but it had an opinion,and it gave it:"The gilding decays,But hog's leather stays!"This the pewter soldier did not believe.8.2 Add  The Old House to your library.Return to the Hans Christian Andersen library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Princess and the Pea "I saw you all over there at home so distinctly, as if you really were here;it was again that Sunday morning; all you children stood before the table andsung your Psalms, as you do every morning. You stood devoutly with foldedhands; and father and mother were just as pious; and then the door was opened,and little sister Mary, who is not two years old yet, and who always danceswhen she hears music or singing, of whatever kind it may be, was put into theroom--though she ought not to have been there--and then she began to dance,but could not keep time, because the tones were so long; and then she stood,first on the one leg, and bent her head forwards, and then on the other leg,and bent her head forwards--but all would not do. You stood very seriously alltogether, although it was difficult enough; but I laughed to myself, and thenI fell off the table, and got a bump, which I have still--for it was notright of me to laugh. But the whole now passes before me again in thought, andeverything that I have lived to see; and these are the old thoughts, with whatthey may bring with them."Tell me if you still sing on Sundays? Tell me something about little Mary!And how my comrade, the other pewter soldier, lives! Yes, he is happy enough,that's sure! I cannot bear it any longer!""You are given away as a present!" said the little boy. "You must remain. Canyou not understand that?"The old man now came with a drawer, in which there was much to be seen, both"tin boxes" and "balsam boxes," old cards, so large and so gilded, such as onenever sees them now. And several drawers were opened, and the piano wasopened; it had landscapes on the inside of the lid, and it was so hoarse whenthe old man played on it! and then he hummed a song."Yes, she could sing that!" said he, and nodded to the portrait, which hehad bought at the broker's, and the old man's eyes shone so bright!"I will go to the wars! I will go to the wars!" shouted the pewter soldier asloud as he could, and threw himself off the drawers right down on the floor.What became of him? The old man sought, and the little boy sought; he wasaway, and he stayed away."I shall find him!" said the old man; but he never found him. The floor wastoo open--the pewter soldier had fallen through a crevice, and there he lay asin an open tomb.That day passed, and the little boy went home, and that week passed, andseveral weeks too. The windows were quite frozen, the little boy was obligedto sit and breathe on them to get a peep-hole over to the old house, and therethe snow had been blown into all the carved work and inscriptions; it layquite up over the steps, just as if there was no one at home--nor was thereany one at home--the old man was dead!In the evening there was a hearse seen before the door, and he was borne intoit in his coffin: he was now to go out into the country, to lie in his grave.He was driven out there, but no one followed; all his friends were dead, andthe little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as it was driven away.Some days afterwards there was an auction at the old house, and the little boysaw from his window how they carried the old knights and the old ladies away,the flower-pots with the long ears, the old chairs, and the oldclothes-presses. Something came here, and something came there; the portraitof her who had been found at the broker's came to the broker's again; andthere it hung, for no one knew her more--no one cared about the old picture.In the spring they pulled the house down, for, as people said, it was a ruin.One could see from the street right into the room with the hog's-leatherhanging, which was slashed and torn; and the green grass and leaves about thebalcony hung quite wild about the falling beams. And then it was put torights."That was a relief," said the neighboring houses.A fine house was built there, with large windows, and smooth white walls; butbefore it, where the old house had in fact stood, was a little garden laidout, and a wild grapevine ran up the wall of the neighboring house. Before thegarden there was a large iron railing with an iron door, it looked quitesplendid, and people stood still and peeped in, and the sparrows hung byscores in the vine, and chattered away at each other as well as they could,but it was not about the old house, for they could not remember it, so manyyears had passed--so many that the little boy had grown up to a whole man,yes, a clever man, and a pleasure to his parents; and he had just beenmarried, and, together with his little wife, had come to live in the househere, where the garden was; and he stood by her there whilst she planted afield-flower that she found so pretty; she planted it with her little hand,and pressed the earth around it with her fingers.

Before thegarden there was a large iron railing with an iron door, it looked quitesplendid, and people stood still and peeped in, and the sparrows hung byscores in the vine, and chattered away at each other as well as they could,but it was not about the old house, for they could not remember it, so manyyears had passed--so many that the little boy had grown up to a whole man,yes, a clever man, and a pleasure to his parents; and he had just beenmarried, and, together with his little wife, had come to live in the househere, where the garden was; and he stood by her there whilst she planted afield-flower that she found so pretty; she planted it with her little hand,and pressed the earth around it with her fingers. Oh! what was that? She hadstuck herself. There sat something pointed, straight out of the soft mould.It was--yes, guess! It was the pewter soldier, he that was lost up at the oldman's, and had tumbled and turned about amongst the timber and the rubbish,and had at last laid for many years in the ground.The young wife wiped the dirt off the soldier, first with a green leaf, andthen with her fine handkerchief--it had such a delightful smell, that it wasto the pewter soldier just as if he had awaked from a trance."Let me see him," said the young man. He laughed, and then shook his head."Nay, it cannot be he; but he reminds me of a story about a pewter soldierwhich I had when I was a little boy!" And then he told his wife about the oldhouse, and the old man, and about the pewter soldier that he sent over to himbecause he was so very, very lonely; and he told it as correctly as it hadreally been, so that the tears came into the eyes of his young wife, onaccount of the old house and the old man."It may possibly be, however, that it is the same pewter soldier!" said she."I will take care of it, and remember all that you have told me; but you mustshow me the old man's grave!""But I do not know it," said he, "and no one knows it! All his friends weredead, no one took care of it, and I was then a little boy!""How very, very lonely he must have been!" said she."Very, very lonely!" said the pewter soldier. "But it is delightful not to beforgotten!""Delightful!" shouted something close by; but no one, except the pewtersoldier, saw that it was a piece of the hog's-leather hangings; it had lostall its gilding, it looked like a piece of wet clay, but it had an opinion,and it gave it:"The gilding decays,But hog's leather stays!"This the pewter soldier did not believe.8.2 Add  The Old House to your library.Return to the Hans Christian Andersen library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Princess and the Pea "I shall find him!" said the old man; but he never found him. The floor wastoo open--the pewter soldier had fallen through a crevice, and there he lay asin an open tomb.That day passed, and the little boy went home, and that week passed, andseveral weeks too. The windows were quite frozen, the little boy was obligedto sit and breathe on them to get a peep-hole over to the old house, and therethe snow had been blown into all the carved work and inscriptions; it layquite up over the steps, just as if there was no one at home--nor was thereany one at home--the old man was dead!In the evening there was a hearse seen before the door, and he was borne intoit in his coffin: he was now to go out into the country, to lie in his grave.He was driven out there, but no one followed; all his friends were dead, andthe little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as it was driven away.Some days afterwards there was an auction at the old house, and the little boysaw from his window how they carried the old knights and the old ladies away,the flower-pots with the long ears, the old chairs, and the oldclothes-presses.

And then he told his wife about the oldhouse, and the old man, and about the pewter soldier that he sent over to himbecause he was so very, very lonely; and he told it as correctly as it hadreally been, so that the tears came into the eyes of his young wife, onaccount of the old house and the old man."It may possibly be, however, that it is the same pewter soldier!" said she."I will take care of it, and remember all that you have told me; but you mustshow me the old man's grave!""But I do not know it," said he, "and no one knows it! All his friends weredead, no one took care of it, and I was then a little boy!""How very, very lonely he must have been!" said she."Very, very lonely!" said the pewter soldier. "But it is delightful not to beforgotten!""Delightful!" shouted something close by; but no one, except the pewtersoldier, saw that it was a piece of the hog's-leather hangings; it had lostall its gilding, it looked like a piece of wet clay, but it had an opinion,and it gave it:"The gilding decays,But hog's leather stays!"This the pewter soldier did not believe.8.2 Add  The Old House to your library.Return to the Hans Christian Andersen library, or . . .
