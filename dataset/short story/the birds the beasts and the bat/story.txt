The Birds and the Beasts declared war against each other. Nocompromise was possible, and so they went at it tooth and claw.It is said the quarrel grew out of the persecution the race ofGeese suffered at the teeth of the Fox family. The Beasts, too,had cause for fight. The Eagle was constantly pouncing on theHare, and the Owl dined daily on Mice. It was a terrible battle. Many a Hare and many a Mouse died.Chickens and Geese fell by the scoreâ€”and the victor alwaysstopped for a feast. Now the Bat family had not openly joined either side. They were avery politic race. So when they saw the Birds getting the betterof it, they were Birds for all there was in it. But when the tideof battle turned, they immediately sided with the Beasts. When the battle was over, the conduct of the Bats was discussedat the peace conference. Such deceit was unpardonable, and Birdsand Beasts made common cause to drive out the Bats. And sincethen the Bat family hides in dark towers and deserted ruins,flying out only in the night. The deceitful have no friends. 8.3 Add  The Birds The Beasts And The Bat to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
