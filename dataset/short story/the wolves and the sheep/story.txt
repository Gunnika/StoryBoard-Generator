A pack of Wolves lurked near the Sheep pasture. But the Dogs keptthem all at a respectful distance, and the Sheep grazed inperfect safety. But now the Wolves thought of a plan to trick theSheep. "Why is there always this hostility between us?" they said. "Ifit were not for those Dogs who are always stirring up trouble, Iam sure we should get along beautifully. Send them away and youwill see what good friends we shall become." The Sheep were easily fooled. They persuaded the Dogs to go away,and that very evening the Wolves had the grandest feast of theirlives. Do not give up friends for foes. 9.1 Add  The Wolves And The Sheep to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
