Northanger Abbey was Austen's first novel (1803) but it was not published until after her death in 1817. Catherine, one of ten children of a clergyman father, is in training to be a heroine, in hopes that life is like a gothic novel (her favorite is Ann Radcliffe's Mysteries of Udolpho). As her life experiences unfold, she realizes she's an ordinary young lady, after all. Illustration at right, entitled, "Catherine scaring herself with Udolpho" is from the 1833 edition. Favorite quote: “Oh! I am delighted with the book! I should like to spend my whole life in reading it.” Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Chapter 7 Chapter 8 Chapter 9 Chapter 10 Chapter 11 Chapter 12 Chapter 13 Chapter 14 Chapter 15 Chapter 16 Chapter 17 Chapter 18 Chapter 19 Chapter 20 Chapter 21 Chapter 22 Chapter 23 Chapter 24 Chapter 25 Chapter 26 Chapter 27 Chapter 28 Chapter 29 Chapter 30 Chapter 31 Return to the Jane Austen library.
