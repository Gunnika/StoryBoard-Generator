Persuasion (1817) was Austen's last novel written before her death in 1817. A second chance at love and a second "bloom" for Anne Elliot, makes for a charming story. Favorite quote: “How quick come the reasons for approving what we like.” Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Chapter 7 Chapter 8 Chapter 9 Chapter 10 Chapter 11 Chapter 12 Chapter 13 Chapter 14 Chapter 15 Chapter 16 Chapter 17 Chapter 18 Chapter 19 Chapter 20 Chapter 21 Chapter 22 Chapter 23 Chapter 24 Return to the Jane Austen library.
