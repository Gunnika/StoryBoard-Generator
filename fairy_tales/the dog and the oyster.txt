There was once a Dog who was very fond of eggs.

He visited thehen house very often and at last got so greedy that he wouldswallow the eggs whole.

One day the Dog wandered down to the seashore.

There he spied anOyster.

In a twinkling the Oyster was resting in the Dog'sstomach, shell and all.

It pained the Dog a good deal, as you can guess.

"I've learned that all round things are not eggs," he saidgroaning.

Act in haste and repent at leisureâ€”and often in pain.
