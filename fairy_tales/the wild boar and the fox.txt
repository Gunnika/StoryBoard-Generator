A Wild Boar was sharpening his tusks busily against the stump ofa tree, when a Fox happened by.

Now the Fox was always lookingfor a chance to make fun of his neighbors.

So he made a greatshow of looking anxiously about, as if in fear of some hiddenenemy.

But the Boar kept right on with his work.

"Why are you doing that?" asked the Fox at last with a grin.

"There isn't any danger that I can see.

" "True enough," replied the Boar, "but when danger does come therewill not be time for such work as this.

My weapons will have tobe ready for use then, or I shall suffer for it.

" Preparedness for war is the best guarantee of peace.
