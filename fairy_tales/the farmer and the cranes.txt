Some Cranes saw a farmer plowing a large field.

When the work ofplowing was done, they patiently watched him sow the seed.

It wastheir feast, they thought.

So, as soon as the Farmer had finished planting and had gonehome, down they flew to the field, and began to eat as fast asthey could.

The Farmer, of course, knew the Cranes and their ways.

He had hadexperience with such birds before.

He soon returned to the fieldwith a sling.

But he did not bring any stones with him.

Heexpected to scare the Cranes just by swinging the sling in theair, and shouting loudly at them.

At first the Cranes flew away in great terror.

But they soonbegan to see that none of them ever got hurt.

They did not evenhear the noise of stones whizzing through the air, and as forwords, they would kill nobody.

At last they paid no attentionwhatever to the Farmer.

The Farmer saw that he would have to take other measures.

Hewanted to save at least some of his grain.

So he loaded his slingwith stones and killed several of the Cranes.

This had the effectthe Farmer wanted, for from that day the Cranes visited his fieldno more.

Bluff and threatening words are of little value with rascals.

Bluff is no proof that hard fists are lacking.
