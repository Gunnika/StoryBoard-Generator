A certain man who visited foreign lands could talk of little whenhe returned to his home except the wonderful adventures he hadmet with and the great deeds he had done abroad.

One of the feats he told about was a leap he had made in a cityCalled Rhodes.

That leap was so great, he said, that no other mancould leap anywhere near the distance.

A great many persons inRhodes had seen him do it and would prove that what he told wastrue.

"No need of witnesses," said one of the hearers.

"Suppose thiscity is Rhodes.

Now show us how far you can jump.

" Deeds count, not boasting words.
