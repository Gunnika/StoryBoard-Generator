There was once a Wolf who got very little to eat because the Dogsof the village were so wide awake and watchful.

He was reallynothing but skin and bones, and it made him very downhearted tothink of it.

One night this Wolf happened to fall in with a fine fat House Dogwho had wandered a little too far from home.

The Wolf wouldgladly have eaten him then and there, but the House Dog lookedstrong enough to leave his marks should he try it.

So the Wolfspoke very humbly to the Dog, complimenting him on his fineappearance.

"You can be as well-fed as I am if you want to," replied the Dog.

"Leave the woods; there you live miserably.

Why, you have tofight hard for every bite you get.

Follow my example and you willget along beautifully.

" "What must I do?" asked the Wolf.

"Hardly anything," answered the House Dog.

"Chase people whocarry canes, bark at beggars, and fawn on the people of thehouse.

In return you will get tidbits of every kind, chickenbones, choice bits of meat, sugar, cake, and much more beside,not to speak of kind words and caresses.

" The Wolf had such a beautiful vision of his coming happiness thathe almost wept.

But just then he noticed that the hair on theDog's neck was worn and the skin was chafed.

"What is that on your neck?" "Nothing at all," replied the Dog.

"What! nothing!" "Oh, just a trifle!" "But please tell me.

" "Perhaps you see the mark of the collar to which my chain isfastened.

" "What! A chain!" cried the Wolf.

"Don't you go wherever youplease?" "Not always! But what's the difference?" replied the Dog.

"All the difference in the world! I don't care a rap for yourfeasts and I wouldn't take all the tender young lambs in theworld at that price.

" And away ran the Wolf to the woods.

There is nothing worth so much as liberty.
