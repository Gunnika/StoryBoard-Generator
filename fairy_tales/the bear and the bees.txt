A Bear roaming the woods in search of berries happened on afallen tree in which a swarm of Bees had stored their honey.

TheBear began to nose around the log very carefully to find out ifthe Bees were at home.

Just then one of the swarm came home fromthe clover field with a load of sweets.

Guessing what the Bearwas after, the Bee flew at him, stung him sharply and thendisappeared into the hollow log.

The Bear lost his temper in an instant, and sprang upon the logtooth and claw, to destroy the nest.

But this only brought outthe whole swarm.

The poor Bear had to take to his heels, and hewas able to save himself only by diving into a pool of water.

It is wiser to bear a single injury in silence than to provoke athousand by flying into a rage.
