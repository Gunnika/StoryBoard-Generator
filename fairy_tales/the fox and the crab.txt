A Crab one day grew disgusted with the sands in which he lived.

He decided to take a stroll to the meadow not far inland.

Therehe would find better fare than briny water and sand mites.

So offhe crawled to the meadow.

But there a hungry Fox spied him, andin a twinkling, ate him up, both shell and claw.

Be content with your lot.
