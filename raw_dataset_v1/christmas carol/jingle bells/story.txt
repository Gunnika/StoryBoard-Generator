A day or two agoI thought I'd take a rideAnd soon, Miss Fanny BrightWas seated by my side,The horse was lean and lankMisfortune seemed his lotHe got into a drifted bankAnd then we got upsot.Jingle bells, jingle bells,Jingle all the way;Oh! what fun it is to rideIn a one-horse open sleigh.Enjoy our selection of Christmas Carols and Christmas Stories.9.2 Add  Jingle Bells to your library.Return to the Anonymous library, or . . .
