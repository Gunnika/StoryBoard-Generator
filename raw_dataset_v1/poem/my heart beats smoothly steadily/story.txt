My heart beats smoothly, steadily,What are long years to me?Under the Galernaya arch,Our shadows, for eternity.Through half-closed eyelids,I see, I see that you're with me,And forever held in your handIs my unopened fan.Because we stood together,In that blessed miraculous moment,The instant of the rose-red moonLifting over the Summer Garden –I've no need to waitAt some hateful window,Or grow weary with meeting –My thirsty love is quenched.You are free, and so am I,Tomorrow will be better than yesterday –Above the Neva's dark waters,Below the Emperor Peter'sCold smile. 6.5 Add  'My heart beats smoothly, steadily,' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
