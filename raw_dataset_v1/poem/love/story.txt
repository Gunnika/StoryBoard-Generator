A snake, it coilsBewitching the heart.Day after day, coosA dove on the white sill.A bright flash in frost,Drowsy night-scented stockâ€¦Yet, sure and secret,It's far from peace and joy.It knows how to weep sweetlyIn the violin's yearning prayer;And is fearfully divinedIn a stranger's smile. 6 Add  Love to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
