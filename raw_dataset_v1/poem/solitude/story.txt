So many stones are thrown at meThat I no longer cower,The turret's cage is shapely,High among high towers.My thanks, to its builders,May they evade pain and woe,Here, I see suns rise earlier,Here, their last splendours glow.And often winds from northern seasFill the windows of my sanctuary,And a dove eats corn from my palmâ€¦And divinely light and calm,The Muse's sunburnt hand's at play,Finishing my unfinished page. 8.6 Add  Solitude to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
