The bright moon lifts from the Mountain of Heaven In an infinite haze of cloud and sea, And the wind, that has come a thousand miles, Beats at the Jade Pass battlements.... China marches its men down Baideng Road While Tartar troops peer across blue waters of the bay.... And since not one battle famous in history Sent all its fighters back again, The soldiers turn round, looking toward the border, And think of home, with wistful eyes, And of those tonight in the upper chambers Who toss and sigh and cannot rest. 8.5 Add  The Moon At The Fortified Pass to your library.Return to the Li Bai library, or . . .
