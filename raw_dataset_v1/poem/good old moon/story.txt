When I was a boy I called the moon awhite plate of jade, sometimes it lookedlike a great mirror hanging in the sky,first came the two legs of the fairyand the cassia tree, but for whom the rabbitkept on pounding medical herbs, Ijust could not guess. Now the moon is beingswallowed by the toad and the lightflickers out leaving darkness all around;I hear that when nine of the burning suns outof the ten were ordered to be shot down bythe Emperor Yao, all has since been quietand peaceful both for heaven and man,but this eating up of the moon is for mea truly ugly scene filling me with forebodingswondering what will come out of it. 8 Add  Good Old Moon to your library.Return to the Li Bai library, or . . .
