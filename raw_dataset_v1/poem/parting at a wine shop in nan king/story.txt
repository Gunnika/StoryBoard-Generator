A wind, bringing willow-cotton, sweetens the shop,And a girl from Wu, pouring wine, urges me to share it.With my comrades of the city who are here to see me off;And as each of them drains his cup, I say to him in parting,Oh, go and ask this river running to the eastIf it can travel farther than a friend's love! 8.5 Add  Parting at a Wine-shop in Nan-king to your library.Return to the Li Bai library, or . . .
