Died for - North of the Rampart - (to an old tune)We fought for Mulberry SpringsDie now for Garlic River.Wash our swords in Parthian Seas,Feed our mounts on T'ien Shan snows.Thousands of miles to and fro.The Three Armies tired and old.These Huns kill instead of ploughing,Sow white bones in desert sand.Ch'in built the Great Wall.Han keeps the bright beacons.These fires never die.These wars never end.Hand to hand we fight and fail,Horses screaming to the skies.Kites and crows pick at our fleshPerch on dead trees with our dead.We paint the grasses red,Because our General had a plan.The sword I say's an evil thing.A wise man keeps it from his hand. 10 Add  We Fought for - South of the Walls to your library.Return to the Li Bai library, or . . .
