Drowsiness returns meTo our last starry paradise –That city of pure fountains,Golden Bakhchisarai.There behind the striped fence,By pensive waters,We remembered with joyThe gardens of Tsarskoye Selo.And suddenly we sawCatherine's eagle – there!Swooping into the valleyFrom the wondrous gate of bronze.To keep the song of the pain of partingAlive in the memory,Autumn in her dark skirtBrought the red leaves.Scattered them on the steps,Where I said farewell,Whence into the realm of shadowsYou my consolation, fled. 4 Add  'Drowsiness returns me' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
