The evening light is broad and yellow,Tender, the April chill.You are many years late,Yet I'm glad you are here.Sit down now, close to me,And look with joyful eyes:Here it is, the blue notebook -Filled with my childhood poems.Forgive me that I lived in sorrow,Rejoiced too little in the sun.Forgive, forgive, that I mistookToo many others for you. 6.9 Add  'The evening light is broad and yellow,' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
