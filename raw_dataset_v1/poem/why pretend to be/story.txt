Why pretend to beNow breeze, now stone, now a bird?Why smile at me,In sudden lightning from summer's sky?Don't torture me further, and don't touch me!Leave me to my prophetic dreamsâ€¦A drunken flame reelsOver the dry grey marshes.And the Muse in a ragged shawl,Sings a long despondent song,With a harsh youthful yearning,With her miraculous strength. 4.7 Add  'Why pretend to be' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
