I'll be there and weariness will vanish.The cold of early morning will please.There are villages, mysterious and dark –Storehouses of immortal labour.My calm and trusting loveOf that place will never be vanquished.There's a drop of Novgorod bloodIn me – a sliver of ice in foaming wine.And that can never be altered,It's un-melted by great heat,And no matter what I may praise –You shine quietly before me. 3 Add  'I'll be there and weariness will vanish.' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
