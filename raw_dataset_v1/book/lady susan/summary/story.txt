Lady Susan is a novel composed as a series of letters (called an "epistolary novel"), one of Austen's earliest works (completed in 1794), but not published until 1871. It's about a seemingly charming, recently widowed, unwanted house guest, at least for his brother's wife because she tried to prevent their marriage. She considers Susan "the most accomplished coquette in England." Favorite quote: “Facts are such horrid things!”Painting at right: Edouard Manet, Berthe Morisot With a Bouquet of Violets, 1872 I.
