A pair of Oxen were drawing a heavily loaded wagon along a mirycountry road. They had to use all their strength to pull thewagon, but they did not complain. The Wheels of the wagon were of a different sort. Though the taskthey had to do was very light compared with that of the Oxen,they creaked and groaned at every turn. The poor Oxen, pullingwith all their might to draw the wagon through the deep mud, hadtheir ears filled with the loud complaining of the Wheels. Andthis, you may well know, made their work so much the harder toendure. "Silence!" the Oxen cried at last, out of patience. "What haveyou Wheels to complain about so loudly? We are drawing all theweight, not you, and we are keeping still about it besides." They complain most who suffer least. 8.4 Add  The Oxen And The Wheels to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
