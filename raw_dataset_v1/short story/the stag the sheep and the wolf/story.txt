One day a Stag came to a Sheep and asked her to lend him ameasure of wheat. The Sheep knew him for a very swift runner, whocould easily take himself out of reach, were he so inclined. Soshe asked him if he knew someone who would answer for him. "Yes, yes," answered the Stag confidently, "the Wolf has promisedto be my surety." "The Wolf!" exclaimed the Sheep indignantly. "Do you think Iwould trust you on such security? I know the Wolf! He takes whathe wants and runs off with it without paying. As for you, you canuse your legs so well that I should have little chance ofcollecting the debt if I had to catch you for it!" Two blacks do not make a white. 8.2 Add  The Stag The Sheep And The Wolf to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
