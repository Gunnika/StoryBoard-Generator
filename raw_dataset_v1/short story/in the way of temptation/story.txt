Martin Green was a young man of good habits and a good conceit ofhimself. He had listened, often and again, with as much patience ashe could assume, to warning and suggestion touching the dangers thatbeset the feet of those who go out into this wicked world, andbecome subject to its legion of temptations. All these warnings andsuggestions he considered as so many words wasted when offered tohimself."I'm in no danger," he would sometimes answer to relative or friend,who ventured a remonstrance against certain associations, orcautioned him about visiting certain places."If I wish to play a game of billiards, I will go to a billiardsaloon," was the firm position he assumed. "Is there any harm inbilliards? I can't help it if bad men play at billiards, andcongregate in billiard saloons. Bad men may be found anywhere andeverywhere; on the street, in stores, at all public places, even inchurch. Shall I stay away from church because bad men are there?"This last argument Martin Green considered unanswerable. Then hewould say,--"If I want a plate of oysters, I'll go to a refectory, and I'll takea glass of ale with my oysters, if it so pleases me. What harm, Iwould like to know? Danger of getting into bad company, you say?Hum-m! Complimentary to your humble servant! But I'm not the kind towhich dirt sticks."So, confident of his own power to stand safely in the midst oftemptation, and ignorant of its thousand insidious approaches,Martin Green, at the age of twenty-one, came and went as he pleased,mingling with the evil and the good, and seeing life undercircumstances of great danger to the pure and innocent. But he feltstrong and safe, confident of neither stumbling nor falling. Allaround him he saw young men yielding to the pressure of temptationand stepping aside into evil ways; but they were weak and vicious,while he stood firm-footed on the rock of virtue!It happened, very naturally, as Green was a bright, social youngman, that he made acquaintances with other young men, who werefrequently met in billiard saloons, theatre lobbies, and eatinghouses. Some of these he did not understand quite as well as heimagined. The vicious, who have ends to gain, know how to cloakthemselves, and easily deceive persons of Green's character. Among,these acquaintances was a handsome, gentlemanly, affable young man,named Bland, who gradually intruded himself into his confidence.Bland never drank to excess, and never seemed inclined to sensualindulgences. He had, moreover, a way of moralizing that completelyveiled his true quality from the not very penetrating Martin Green,whose shrewdness and knowledge of character were far less acute thanhe, in his self-conceit, imagined.One evening, instead of going with his sister to the house of afriend, where a select company of highly-intelligent ladies andgentleman were to meet, and pass an evening together, Martin excusedhimself under the pretence of an engagement, and lounged away to aneating and drinking saloon, there to spend an hour in smoking,reading the newspapers, and enjoying a glass of ale, the desire forwhich was fast growing into a habit. Strong and safe as he imaginedhimself, the very fact of preferring the atmosphere of a drinking orbilliard saloon to that in which refined and intellectual peoplebreathe, showed that he was weak and in danger.He was sitting with a cigar in his mouth, and a glass of ale besidehim, reading with the air of a man who felt entirely satisfied withhimself, and rather proud than ashamed of his position andsurroundings, when his pleasant friend, Mr. Bland, crossed the room,and, reaching out his hand, said, with his smiling, hearty manner,--"How are you, my friend? What's the news to-day?" And he drew achair to the table, calling at the same time to a waiter for a glassof ale."I never drink anything stronger than ale," he added, in aconfidential way, not waiting for Green to answer his first remark."Liquors are so drugged nowadays, that you never know what poisonyou are taking; besides, tippling is a bad habit, and sets aquestionable example. We must, you know, have some regard to theeffect of our conduct on weaker people. Man is an imitative animal.By the way, did you see Booth's Cardinal Wolsey?""Yes.""A splendid piece of acting,--was it not? You remember, after thecardinal's fall, that noble passage to which he gives utterance. Ithas been running through my mind ever since:--"'Mark but my fall,and that that ruined me.Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,The image of his Maker, hope to win by't?Love thyself last: Cherish those hearts that hate thee:Corruption wins not more than honesty.Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,To silence envious tongues; be just, and fear not.Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st, O Cromwell,Thou fall'st a blessed martyr.'"'Love thyself last.--Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thycountry's, thy God's, and truth's.' Could a man's whole duty in lifebe expressed in fewer words, or said more grandly? I think not."And so he went on, charming the ears of Green, and inspiring himwith the belief that he was a person of the purest instincts andnoblest ends. While they talked, two young men, strangers to Greencame up, and were introduced by Bland as "My very particularfriends." Something about them did not at first impress Martinfavorably. But this impression soon wore off, they were sointelligent and agreeable, Bland, after a little while, referredagain to the Cardinal Wolsey of Booth, and, drawing a copy ofShakspeare's Henry VIII. from his pocket, remarked,--"If it wasn't so public here, I'd like to read a few of the bestpassages in Wolsey's part.""Can't we get a private room?" said one of the two young men who hadjoined Bland and Green. "There are plenty in the house. I'll see."And away he went to the bar."Come," he said, returning in a few minutes; and the party followeda waiter up stairs, and were shown into a small room, neatlyfurnished, though smelling villanously of stale cigar smoke."This is cosy," was the approving remark of Bland, as they entered.Hats and overcoats were laid aside, and they drew around a tablethat stood in the centre of the room under the gaslight. A fewpassages were read from Shakspeare, then drink was ordered by one ofthe the party. The reading interspersed with critical comments, wasagain resumed; but the reading soon gave way entire to the comments,which, in a little while, passed from the text of Shakspeare toactors, actresses, prima donnas, and ballet-dancers, the relativemerits of which were knowingly discussed for some time. In the midstof this discussion, oysters, in two or three styles, and a smokingdish of terrapin, ordered by a member of the company--which our youngfriend Green did not know--were brought in, followed by a liberalsupply of wine and brandy. Bland expressed surprise, but acceptedthe entertainment as quite agreeable to himself.After the supper, cigars were introduced, and after the cigars,cards. A few games were played for shilling stakes. Green, under theinfluence of more liquor than his head could bear, and in the midstof companions whose sphere he could not, in consequence, resist,yielded in a new direction for him. Of gambling he had alwaysentertained a virtuous disapproval; yet, ere aware of the directionin which he was drifting, he was staking money at cards, the sumsgradually increasing, until from shillings the ventures increased todollars. Sometimes he won, and sometimes he lost; the winningsstimulating to new trials in the hope of further success, and thelosses stimulating to new trials in order to recover, if possible;but, steadily, the tide, for all these little eddies of success,bore him downwards, and losses increased from single dollars tofives, and from fives to tens, his pleasant friend, Bland, supplyingwhatever he wanted in the most disinterested way, until an aggregateloss of nearly a hundred and fifty dollars sobered and appalled him.The salary of Martin Green was only four hundred dollars, every centof which was expended as fast as earned. A loss of a hundred andfifty dollars was, therefore, a serious and embarrassing matter."I'll call and see you to-morrow, when we can arrange this littlematter," said Mr. Bland, "on parting with Green at his own door. Hespoke pleasantly, but with something in his voice that chilled thenerves of his victim. On the next day while Green stood at his desk,trying to fix his mind upon his work, and do it correctly, hisemployer said,--"Martin, there's a young man in the store who has asked for you."Green turned and saw the last man on the earth he desired to meet.His pleasant friend of the evening before had called to "arrangethat little matter.""Not too soon for you, I hope," remarked Bland, with his courteous,yet now serious, smile, as he took the victim's hand."Yes, you are, too soon," was soberly answered.The smile faded off of Bland's face."When will you arrange it?""In a few days.""But I want the money to-day. It was a simple loan, you know.""I am aware of that, but the amount is larger than I can manage atonce," said Green."Can I have a part to-day?""Not to-day.""To-morrow, then?""I'll do the best in my power.""Very well. To-morrow, at this time, I will call. Make up the wholesum if possible, for I want it badly.""Do you know that young man?" asked Mr. Phillips, the employer ofGreen, as the latter came back to his desk. The face of Mr. Phillipswas unusually serious."His name is Bland.""Why has he called to see you?" The eyes of Mr. Phillips were fixedintently on his clerk."He merely dropped in. I have met him a few times in company.""Don't you know his character?""I never heard a word against him," said Green."Why, Martin!" replied Mr. Phillips, "he has the reputation of beingone of the worst young men in our city; a base gambler'sstool-pigeon, some say.""I am glad to know it, sir," Martin had the presence of mind, in thepainful confusion that overwhelmed him, to say, "and shall treat himaccordingly." He went back to his desk, and resumed his work.It is the easiest thing in the world to go to astray, but alwaysdifficult to return, Martin Green was astray, but how was he to getinto the right path again? A barrier that seemed impassable was nowlying across the way over which he had passed, a little whilebefore, with lightest footsteps. Alone and unaided, he could notsafely get back. The evil spirits that lure a man from virtue nevercounsel aright when to seek to return. They magnify the perils thatbeset the road by which alone is safety, and suggest other ways thatlead into labyrinths of evil from which escape is sometimesimpossible. These spirits were now at the ear of our unhappy youngfriend, suggesting methods of relief in his embarrassing position.If Bland were indeed such a character as Mr. Phillips hadrepresented him, it would be ruin, in his employer's estimation, tohave him call again and again for his debt. But how was he toliquidate that debt? There was nothing due him on account of salary,and there was not a friend or acquaintance to whom he could applywith any hope of borrowing."Man's extremity is the devil's opportunity." It was so in thepresent case, Green had a number of collections to make on that day,and his evil counsellors suggested his holding back the return oftwo of these, amounting to his indebtedness, and say that theparties were not yet ready to settle their bills. This would enablehim to get rid of Bland, and gain time. So, acting upon the badsuggestion, he made up his return of collections, omitting the twoaccounts to which we have referred.Now it so happened that one of the persons against whom theseaccounts stood, met Mr. Phillips as he was returning from dinner inthe afternoon, and said to him,--"I settled that bill of yours to-day.""That's right. I wish all my customers were as punctual," answeredMr. Phillips."I gave your young man a check for a hundred and five dollars.""Thank you."And the two men passed their respective ways.On Mr. Phillips's return to his store, Martin rendered his accountof collections, and, to the surprise of his employer, omitted theone in regard to which he had just been notified."Is this all?" he asked, in a tone that sent a thrill of alarm tothe guilty heart of his clerk."Yes, sir," was the not clearly outspoken answer."Didn't Garland pay?""N-n-o, sir!" The suddenness of this question so confounded Martin,that he could not answer without a betraying hesitation."Martin!" Astonishment, rebuke, and accusation were in the voice ofMr. Phillips as he pronounced his clerk's name. Martin's faceflushed deeply, and then grew very pale. He stood the image of guiltand fear for some moments, then, drawing out his pocket book, hebrought therefrom a small roll of bank bills, and a memorandum slipof paper."I made these collections also." And he gave the money andmemorandum to Mr. Phillips."A hundred and fifty dollars withheld! Martin! Martin! what doesthis mean?""Heaven is my witness, sir," answered the young man, with quiveringlips, "that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had nointention of wronging you now. But I am in a fearful strait. My feethave become suddenly mired, and this was a desperate struggle forextrication--a temporary expedient only, not a premeditated wrongagainst you.""Sit down, Martin," said Mr. Phillips, in a grave, but not severe,tone of voice. "Let me understand the case from first to last.Conceal nothing, if you wish to have me for a friend."Thus enjoined, Martin told his humiliating story."If you had not gone into the way of temptation, the betrayer hadnot found you," was the remark of Mr. Phillips, when the young manended his confession. "Do you frequent these eating and drinkingsaloons?""I go occasionally, sir.""They are neither safe nor reputable, Martin. A young man whofrequents them must have the fine tone of his manhood dimmed. Thereis an atmosphere of impurity about these places. Have you a youngerbrother?""Yes, sir.""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth tomanhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?""No, sir, I would do all in my power to prevent it.""Why?""There's danger in them, sir.""And, knowing this, you went into the way of danger, and havefallen!"Martin dropped his eyes to the floor in confusion."Bland is a stool-pigeon and you were betrayed.""What am I to do?" asked the troubled young man. "I am in debt tohim.""He will be here to-morrow.""Yes, sir.""I will have a policeman ready to receive him.""O, no, no, Sir. Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself. I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth. One experiencelike this should last you a life-time."Thus Martin escaped from his dangerous entanglement, but never againto hold the unwavering confidence of his employer. Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green. He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; It's None of My Business "I'm in no danger," he would sometimes answer to relative or friend,who ventured a remonstrance against certain associations, orcautioned him about visiting certain places."If I wish to play a game of billiards, I will go to a billiardsaloon," was the firm position he assumed. "Is there any harm inbilliards? I can't help it if bad men play at billiards, andcongregate in billiard saloons. Bad men may be found anywhere andeverywhere; on the street, in stores, at all public places, even inchurch.

The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth. One experiencelike this should last you a life-time."Thus Martin escaped from his dangerous entanglement, but never againto hold the unwavering confidence of his employer. Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green. He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; It's None of My Business "If I wish to play a game of billiards, I will go to a billiardsaloon," was the firm position he assumed. "Is there any harm inbilliards? I can't help it if bad men play at billiards, andcongregate in billiard saloons. Bad men may be found anywhere andeverywhere; on the street, in stores, at all public places, even inchurch. Shall I stay away from church because bad men are there?"This last argument Martin Green considered unanswerable. Then hewould say,--"If I want a plate of oysters, I'll go to a refectory, and I'll takea glass of ale with my oysters, if it so pleases me. What harm, Iwould like to know? Danger of getting into bad company, you say?Hum-m! Complimentary to your humble servant! But I'm not the kind towhich dirt sticks."So, confident of his own power to stand safely in the midst oftemptation, and ignorant of its thousand insidious approaches,Martin Green, at the age of twenty-one, came and went as he pleased,mingling with the evil and the good, and seeing life undercircumstances of great danger to the pure and innocent. But he feltstrong and safe, confident of neither stumbling nor falling. Allaround him he saw young men yielding to the pressure of temptationand stepping aside into evil ways; but they were weak and vicious,while he stood firm-footed on the rock of virtue!It happened, very naturally, as Green was a bright, social youngman, that he made acquaintances with other young men, who werefrequently met in billiard saloons, theatre lobbies, and eatinghouses. Some of these he did not understand quite as well as heimagined. The vicious, who have ends to gain, know how to cloakthemselves, and easily deceive persons of Green's character. Among,these acquaintances was a handsome, gentlemanly, affable young man,named Bland, who gradually intruded himself into his confidence.Bland never drank to excess, and never seemed inclined to sensualindulgences. He had, moreover, a way of moralizing that completelyveiled his true quality from the not very penetrating Martin Green,whose shrewdness and knowledge of character were far less acute thanhe, in his self-conceit, imagined.One evening, instead of going with his sister to the house of afriend, where a select company of highly-intelligent ladies andgentleman were to meet, and pass an evening together, Martin excusedhimself under the pretence of an engagement, and lounged away to aneating and drinking saloon, there to spend an hour in smoking,reading the newspapers, and enjoying a glass of ale, the desire forwhich was fast growing into a habit. Strong and safe as he imaginedhimself, the very fact of preferring the atmosphere of a drinking orbilliard saloon to that in which refined and intellectual peoplebreathe, showed that he was weak and in danger.He was sitting with a cigar in his mouth, and a glass of ale besidehim, reading with the air of a man who felt entirely satisfied withhimself, and rather proud than ashamed of his position andsurroundings, when his pleasant friend, Mr. Bland, crossed the room,and, reaching out his hand, said, with his smiling, hearty manner,--"How are you, my friend? What's the news to-day?" And he drew achair to the table, calling at the same time to a waiter for a glassof ale."I never drink anything stronger than ale," he added, in aconfidential way, not waiting for Green to answer his first remark."Liquors are so drugged nowadays, that you never know what poisonyou are taking; besides, tippling is a bad habit, and sets aquestionable example. We must, you know, have some regard to theeffect of our conduct on weaker people. Man is an imitative animal.By the way, did you see Booth's Cardinal Wolsey?""Yes.""A splendid piece of acting,--was it not? You remember, after thecardinal's fall, that noble passage to which he gives utterance. Ithas been running through my mind ever since:--"'Mark but my fall,and that that ruined me.Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,The image of his Maker, hope to win by't?Love thyself last: Cherish those hearts that hate thee:Corruption wins not more than honesty.Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,To silence envious tongues; be just, and fear not.Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st, O Cromwell,Thou fall'st a blessed martyr.'"'Love thyself last.--Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thycountry's, thy God's, and truth's.' Could a man's whole duty in lifebe expressed in fewer words, or said more grandly? I think not."And so he went on, charming the ears of Green, and inspiring himwith the belief that he was a person of the purest instincts andnoblest ends. While they talked, two young men, strangers to Greencame up, and were introduced by Bland as "My very particularfriends." Something about them did not at first impress Martinfavorably. But this impression soon wore off, they were sointelligent and agreeable, Bland, after a little while, referredagain to the Cardinal Wolsey of Booth, and, drawing a copy ofShakspeare's Henry VIII. from his pocket, remarked,--"If it wasn't so public here, I'd like to read a few of the bestpassages in Wolsey's part.""Can't we get a private room?" said one of the two young men who hadjoined Bland and Green. "There are plenty in the house. I'll see."And away he went to the bar."Come," he said, returning in a few minutes; and the party followeda waiter up stairs, and were shown into a small room, neatlyfurnished, though smelling villanously of stale cigar smoke."This is cosy," was the approving remark of Bland, as they entered.Hats and overcoats were laid aside, and they drew around a tablethat stood in the centre of the room under the gaslight. A fewpassages were read from Shakspeare, then drink was ordered by one ofthe the party. The reading interspersed with critical comments, wasagain resumed; but the reading soon gave way entire to the comments,which, in a little while, passed from the text of Shakspeare toactors, actresses, prima donnas, and ballet-dancers, the relativemerits of which were knowingly discussed for some time. In the midstof this discussion, oysters, in two or three styles, and a smokingdish of terrapin, ordered by a member of the company--which our youngfriend Green did not know--were brought in, followed by a liberalsupply of wine and brandy. Bland expressed surprise, but acceptedthe entertainment as quite agreeable to himself.After the supper, cigars were introduced, and after the cigars,cards. A few games were played for shilling stakes. Green, under theinfluence of more liquor than his head could bear, and in the midstof companions whose sphere he could not, in consequence, resist,yielded in a new direction for him. Of gambling he had alwaysentertained a virtuous disapproval; yet, ere aware of the directionin which he was drifting, he was staking money at cards, the sumsgradually increasing, until from shillings the ventures increased todollars. Sometimes he won, and sometimes he lost; the winningsstimulating to new trials in the hope of further success, and thelosses stimulating to new trials in order to recover, if possible;but, steadily, the tide, for all these little eddies of success,bore him downwards, and losses increased from single dollars tofives, and from fives to tens, his pleasant friend, Bland, supplyingwhatever he wanted in the most disinterested way, until an aggregateloss of nearly a hundred and fifty dollars sobered and appalled him.The salary of Martin Green was only four hundred dollars, every centof which was expended as fast as earned. A loss of a hundred andfifty dollars was, therefore, a serious and embarrassing matter."I'll call and see you to-morrow, when we can arrange this littlematter," said Mr. Bland, "on parting with Green at his own door. Hespoke pleasantly, but with something in his voice that chilled thenerves of his victim. On the next day while Green stood at his desk,trying to fix his mind upon his work, and do it correctly, hisemployer said,--"Martin, there's a young man in the store who has asked for you."Green turned and saw the last man on the earth he desired to meet.His pleasant friend of the evening before had called to "arrangethat little matter.""Not too soon for you, I hope," remarked Bland, with his courteous,yet now serious, smile, as he took the victim's hand."Yes, you are, too soon," was soberly answered.The smile faded off of Bland's face."When will you arrange it?""In a few days.""But I want the money to-day. It was a simple loan, you know.""I am aware of that, but the amount is larger than I can manage atonce," said Green."Can I have a part to-day?""Not to-day.""To-morrow, then?""I'll do the best in my power.""Very well. To-morrow, at this time, I will call. Make up the wholesum if possible, for I want it badly.""Do you know that young man?" asked Mr. Phillips, the employer ofGreen, as the latter came back to his desk. The face of Mr. Phillipswas unusually serious."His name is Bland.""Why has he called to see you?" The eyes of Mr. Phillips were fixedintently on his clerk."He merely dropped in. I have met him a few times in company.""Don't you know his character?""I never heard a word against him," said Green."Why, Martin!" replied Mr. Phillips, "he has the reputation of beingone of the worst young men in our city; a base gambler'sstool-pigeon, some say.""I am glad to know it, sir," Martin had the presence of mind, in thepainful confusion that overwhelmed him, to say, "and shall treat himaccordingly." He went back to his desk, and resumed his work.It is the easiest thing in the world to go to astray, but alwaysdifficult to return, Martin Green was astray, but how was he to getinto the right path again? A barrier that seemed impassable was nowlying across the way over which he had passed, a little whilebefore, with lightest footsteps. Alone and unaided, he could notsafely get back. The evil spirits that lure a man from virtue nevercounsel aright when to seek to return. They magnify the perils thatbeset the road by which alone is safety, and suggest other ways thatlead into labyrinths of evil from which escape is sometimesimpossible. These spirits were now at the ear of our unhappy youngfriend, suggesting methods of relief in his embarrassing position.If Bland were indeed such a character as Mr. Phillips hadrepresented him, it would be ruin, in his employer's estimation, tohave him call again and again for his debt. But how was he toliquidate that debt? There was nothing due him on account of salary,and there was not a friend or acquaintance to whom he could applywith any hope of borrowing."Man's extremity is the devil's opportunity." It was so in thepresent case, Green had a number of collections to make on that day,and his evil counsellors suggested his holding back the return oftwo of these, amounting to his indebtedness, and say that theparties were not yet ready to settle their bills. This would enablehim to get rid of Bland, and gain time. So, acting upon the badsuggestion, he made up his return of collections, omitting the twoaccounts to which we have referred.Now it so happened that one of the persons against whom theseaccounts stood, met Mr. Phillips as he was returning from dinner inthe afternoon, and said to him,--"I settled that bill of yours to-day.""That's right. I wish all my customers were as punctual," answeredMr. Phillips."I gave your young man a check for a hundred and five dollars.""Thank you."And the two men passed their respective ways.On Mr. Phillips's return to his store, Martin rendered his accountof collections, and, to the surprise of his employer, omitted theone in regard to which he had just been notified."Is this all?" he asked, in a tone that sent a thrill of alarm tothe guilty heart of his clerk."Yes, sir," was the not clearly outspoken answer."Didn't Garland pay?""N-n-o, sir!" The suddenness of this question so confounded Martin,that he could not answer without a betraying hesitation."Martin!" Astonishment, rebuke, and accusation were in the voice ofMr. Phillips as he pronounced his clerk's name. Martin's faceflushed deeply, and then grew very pale. He stood the image of guiltand fear for some moments, then, drawing out his pocket book, hebrought therefrom a small roll of bank bills, and a memorandum slipof paper."I made these collections also." And he gave the money andmemorandum to Mr. Phillips."A hundred and fifty dollars withheld! Martin! Martin! what doesthis mean?""Heaven is my witness, sir," answered the young man, with quiveringlips, "that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had nointention of wronging you now. But I am in a fearful strait. My feethave become suddenly mired, and this was a desperate struggle forextrication--a temporary expedient only, not a premeditated wrongagainst you.""Sit down, Martin," said Mr. Phillips, in a grave, but not severe,tone of voice. "Let me understand the case from first to last.Conceal nothing, if you wish to have me for a friend."Thus enjoined, Martin told his humiliating story."If you had not gone into the way of temptation, the betrayer hadnot found you," was the remark of Mr. Phillips, when the young manended his confession. "Do you frequent these eating and drinkingsaloons?""I go occasionally, sir.""They are neither safe nor reputable, Martin. A young man whofrequents them must have the fine tone of his manhood dimmed. Thereis an atmosphere of impurity about these places. Have you a youngerbrother?""Yes, sir.""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth tomanhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?""No, sir, I would do all in my power to prevent it.""Why?""There's danger in them, sir.""And, knowing this, you went into the way of danger, and havefallen!"Martin dropped his eyes to the floor in confusion."Bland is a stool-pigeon and you were betrayed.""What am I to do?" asked the troubled young man. "I am in debt tohim.""He will be here to-morrow.""Yes, sir.""I will have a policeman ready to receive him.""O, no, no, Sir. Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself. I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you.

And he gave the money andmemorandum to Mr. Phillips."A hundred and fifty dollars withheld! Martin! Martin! what doesthis mean?""Heaven is my witness, sir," answered the young man, with quiveringlips, "that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had nointention of wronging you now. But I am in a fearful strait. My feethave become suddenly mired, and this was a desperate struggle forextrication--a temporary expedient only, not a premeditated wrongagainst you.""Sit down, Martin," said Mr. Phillips, in a grave, but not severe,tone of voice. "Let me understand the case from first to last.Conceal nothing, if you wish to have me for a friend."Thus enjoined, Martin told his humiliating story."If you had not gone into the way of temptation, the betrayer hadnot found you," was the remark of Mr. Phillips, when the young manended his confession. "Do you frequent these eating and drinkingsaloons?""I go occasionally, sir.""They are neither safe nor reputable, Martin. A young man whofrequents them must have the fine tone of his manhood dimmed. Thereis an atmosphere of impurity about these places. Have you a youngerbrother?""Yes, sir.""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth tomanhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?""No, sir, I would do all in my power to prevent it.""Why?""There's danger in them, sir.""And, knowing this, you went into the way of danger, and havefallen!"Martin dropped his eyes to the floor in confusion."Bland is a stool-pigeon and you were betrayed.""What am I to do?" asked the troubled young man. "I am in debt tohim.""He will be here to-morrow.""Yes, sir.""I will have a policeman ready to receive him.""O, no, no, Sir. Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself. I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth. One experiencelike this should last you a life-time."Thus Martin escaped from his dangerous entanglement, but never againto hold the unwavering confidence of his employer. Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green. He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; It's None of My Business "If I want a plate of oysters, I'll go to a refectory, and I'll takea glass of ale with my oysters, if it so pleases me. What harm, Iwould like to know? Danger of getting into bad company, you say?Hum-m! Complimentary to your humble servant! But I'm not the kind towhich dirt sticks."So, confident of his own power to stand safely in the midst oftemptation, and ignorant of its thousand insidious approaches,Martin Green, at the age of twenty-one, came and went as he pleased,mingling with the evil and the good, and seeing life undercircumstances of great danger to the pure and innocent. But he feltstrong and safe, confident of neither stumbling nor falling. Allaround him he saw young men yielding to the pressure of temptationand stepping aside into evil ways; but they were weak and vicious,while he stood firm-footed on the rock of virtue!It happened, very naturally, as Green was a bright, social youngman, that he made acquaintances with other young men, who werefrequently met in billiard saloons, theatre lobbies, and eatinghouses. Some of these he did not understand quite as well as heimagined. The vicious, who have ends to gain, know how to cloakthemselves, and easily deceive persons of Green's character. Among,these acquaintances was a handsome, gentlemanly, affable young man,named Bland, who gradually intruded himself into his confidence.Bland never drank to excess, and never seemed inclined to sensualindulgences. He had, moreover, a way of moralizing that completelyveiled his true quality from the not very penetrating Martin Green,whose shrewdness and knowledge of character were far less acute thanhe, in his self-conceit, imagined.One evening, instead of going with his sister to the house of afriend, where a select company of highly-intelligent ladies andgentleman were to meet, and pass an evening together, Martin excusedhimself under the pretence of an engagement, and lounged away to aneating and drinking saloon, there to spend an hour in smoking,reading the newspapers, and enjoying a glass of ale, the desire forwhich was fast growing into a habit. Strong and safe as he imaginedhimself, the very fact of preferring the atmosphere of a drinking orbilliard saloon to that in which refined and intellectual peoplebreathe, showed that he was weak and in danger.He was sitting with a cigar in his mouth, and a glass of ale besidehim, reading with the air of a man who felt entirely satisfied withhimself, and rather proud than ashamed of his position andsurroundings, when his pleasant friend, Mr. Bland, crossed the room,and, reaching out his hand, said, with his smiling, hearty manner,--"How are you, my friend? What's the news to-day?" And he drew achair to the table, calling at the same time to a waiter for a glassof ale."I never drink anything stronger than ale," he added, in aconfidential way, not waiting for Green to answer his first remark."Liquors are so drugged nowadays, that you never know what poisonyou are taking; besides, tippling is a bad habit, and sets aquestionable example. We must, you know, have some regard to theeffect of our conduct on weaker people. Man is an imitative animal.By the way, did you see Booth's Cardinal Wolsey?""Yes.""A splendid piece of acting,--was it not? You remember, after thecardinal's fall, that noble passage to which he gives utterance. Ithas been running through my mind ever since:--"'Mark but my fall,and that that ruined me.Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,The image of his Maker, hope to win by't?Love thyself last: Cherish those hearts that hate thee:Corruption wins not more than honesty.Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,To silence envious tongues; be just, and fear not.Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st, O Cromwell,Thou fall'st a blessed martyr.'"'Love thyself last.--Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thycountry's, thy God's, and truth's.' Could a man's whole duty in lifebe expressed in fewer words, or said more grandly? I think not."And so he went on, charming the ears of Green, and inspiring himwith the belief that he was a person of the purest instincts andnoblest ends. While they talked, two young men, strangers to Greencame up, and were introduced by Bland as "My very particularfriends." Something about them did not at first impress Martinfavorably. But this impression soon wore off, they were sointelligent and agreeable, Bland, after a little while, referredagain to the Cardinal Wolsey of Booth, and, drawing a copy ofShakspeare's Henry VIII. from his pocket, remarked,--"If it wasn't so public here, I'd like to read a few of the bestpassages in Wolsey's part.""Can't we get a private room?" said one of the two young men who hadjoined Bland and Green. "There are plenty in the house. I'll see."And away he went to the bar."Come," he said, returning in a few minutes; and the party followeda waiter up stairs, and were shown into a small room, neatlyfurnished, though smelling villanously of stale cigar smoke."This is cosy," was the approving remark of Bland, as they entered.Hats and overcoats were laid aside, and they drew around a tablethat stood in the centre of the room under the gaslight. A fewpassages were read from Shakspeare, then drink was ordered by one ofthe the party. The reading interspersed with critical comments, wasagain resumed; but the reading soon gave way entire to the comments,which, in a little while, passed from the text of Shakspeare toactors, actresses, prima donnas, and ballet-dancers, the relativemerits of which were knowingly discussed for some time. In the midstof this discussion, oysters, in two or three styles, and a smokingdish of terrapin, ordered by a member of the company--which our youngfriend Green did not know--were brought in, followed by a liberalsupply of wine and brandy. Bland expressed surprise, but acceptedthe entertainment as quite agreeable to himself.After the supper, cigars were introduced, and after the cigars,cards. A few games were played for shilling stakes. Green, under theinfluence of more liquor than his head could bear, and in the midstof companions whose sphere he could not, in consequence, resist,yielded in a new direction for him. Of gambling he had alwaysentertained a virtuous disapproval; yet, ere aware of the directionin which he was drifting, he was staking money at cards, the sumsgradually increasing, until from shillings the ventures increased todollars. Sometimes he won, and sometimes he lost; the winningsstimulating to new trials in the hope of further success, and thelosses stimulating to new trials in order to recover, if possible;but, steadily, the tide, for all these little eddies of success,bore him downwards, and losses increased from single dollars tofives, and from fives to tens, his pleasant friend, Bland, supplyingwhatever he wanted in the most disinterested way, until an aggregateloss of nearly a hundred and fifty dollars sobered and appalled him.The salary of Martin Green was only four hundred dollars, every centof which was expended as fast as earned. A loss of a hundred andfifty dollars was, therefore, a serious and embarrassing matter."I'll call and see you to-morrow, when we can arrange this littlematter," said Mr. Bland, "on parting with Green at his own door. Hespoke pleasantly, but with something in his voice that chilled thenerves of his victim. On the next day while Green stood at his desk,trying to fix his mind upon his work, and do it correctly, hisemployer said,--"Martin, there's a young man in the store who has asked for you."Green turned and saw the last man on the earth he desired to meet.His pleasant friend of the evening before had called to "arrangethat little matter.""Not too soon for you, I hope," remarked Bland, with his courteous,yet now serious, smile, as he took the victim's hand."Yes, you are, too soon," was soberly answered.The smile faded off of Bland's face."When will you arrange it?""In a few days.""But I want the money to-day. It was a simple loan, you know.""I am aware of that, but the amount is larger than I can manage atonce," said Green."Can I have a part to-day?""Not to-day.""To-morrow, then?""I'll do the best in my power.""Very well. To-morrow, at this time, I will call. Make up the wholesum if possible, for I want it badly.""Do you know that young man?" asked Mr. Phillips, the employer ofGreen, as the latter came back to his desk. The face of Mr. Phillipswas unusually serious."His name is Bland.""Why has he called to see you?" The eyes of Mr. Phillips were fixedintently on his clerk."He merely dropped in. I have met him a few times in company.""Don't you know his character?""I never heard a word against him," said Green."Why, Martin!" replied Mr. Phillips, "he has the reputation of beingone of the worst young men in our city; a base gambler'sstool-pigeon, some say.""I am glad to know it, sir," Martin had the presence of mind, in thepainful confusion that overwhelmed him, to say, "and shall treat himaccordingly." He went back to his desk, and resumed his work.It is the easiest thing in the world to go to astray, but alwaysdifficult to return, Martin Green was astray, but how was he to getinto the right path again? A barrier that seemed impassable was nowlying across the way over which he had passed, a little whilebefore, with lightest footsteps. Alone and unaided, he could notsafely get back. The evil spirits that lure a man from virtue nevercounsel aright when to seek to return. They magnify the perils thatbeset the road by which alone is safety, and suggest other ways thatlead into labyrinths of evil from which escape is sometimesimpossible. These spirits were now at the ear of our unhappy youngfriend, suggesting methods of relief in his embarrassing position.If Bland were indeed such a character as Mr. Phillips hadrepresented him, it would be ruin, in his employer's estimation, tohave him call again and again for his debt. But how was he toliquidate that debt? There was nothing due him on account of salary,and there was not a friend or acquaintance to whom he could applywith any hope of borrowing."Man's extremity is the devil's opportunity." It was so in thepresent case, Green had a number of collections to make on that day,and his evil counsellors suggested his holding back the return oftwo of these, amounting to his indebtedness, and say that theparties were not yet ready to settle their bills. This would enablehim to get rid of Bland, and gain time. So, acting upon the badsuggestion, he made up his return of collections, omitting the twoaccounts to which we have referred.Now it so happened that one of the persons against whom theseaccounts stood, met Mr. Phillips as he was returning from dinner inthe afternoon, and said to him,--"I settled that bill of yours to-day.""That's right. I wish all my customers were as punctual," answeredMr. Phillips."I gave your young man a check for a hundred and five dollars.""Thank you."And the two men passed their respective ways.On Mr. Phillips's return to his store, Martin rendered his accountof collections, and, to the surprise of his employer, omitted theone in regard to which he had just been notified."Is this all?" he asked, in a tone that sent a thrill of alarm tothe guilty heart of his clerk."Yes, sir," was the not clearly outspoken answer."Didn't Garland pay?""N-n-o, sir!" The suddenness of this question so confounded Martin,that he could not answer without a betraying hesitation."Martin!" Astonishment, rebuke, and accusation were in the voice ofMr. Phillips as he pronounced his clerk's name. Martin's faceflushed deeply, and then grew very pale. He stood the image of guiltand fear for some moments, then, drawing out his pocket book, hebrought therefrom a small roll of bank bills, and a memorandum slipof paper."I made these collections also." And he gave the money andmemorandum to Mr. Phillips."A hundred and fifty dollars withheld! Martin! Martin! what doesthis mean?""Heaven is my witness, sir," answered the young man, with quiveringlips, "that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had nointention of wronging you now. But I am in a fearful strait. My feethave become suddenly mired, and this was a desperate struggle forextrication--a temporary expedient only, not a premeditated wrongagainst you.""Sit down, Martin," said Mr. Phillips, in a grave, but not severe,tone of voice. "Let me understand the case from first to last.Conceal nothing, if you wish to have me for a friend."Thus enjoined, Martin told his humiliating story."If you had not gone into the way of temptation, the betrayer hadnot found you," was the remark of Mr. Phillips, when the young manended his confession.

There was nothing due him on account of salary,and there was not a friend or acquaintance to whom he could applywith any hope of borrowing."Man's extremity is the devil's opportunity." It was so in thepresent case, Green had a number of collections to make on that day,and his evil counsellors suggested his holding back the return oftwo of these, amounting to his indebtedness, and say that theparties were not yet ready to settle their bills. This would enablehim to get rid of Bland, and gain time. So, acting upon the badsuggestion, he made up his return of collections, omitting the twoaccounts to which we have referred.Now it so happened that one of the persons against whom theseaccounts stood, met Mr. Phillips as he was returning from dinner inthe afternoon, and said to him,--"I settled that bill of yours to-day.""That's right. I wish all my customers were as punctual," answeredMr. Phillips."I gave your young man a check for a hundred and five dollars.""Thank you."And the two men passed their respective ways.On Mr. Phillips's return to his store, Martin rendered his accountof collections, and, to the surprise of his employer, omitted theone in regard to which he had just been notified."Is this all?" he asked, in a tone that sent a thrill of alarm tothe guilty heart of his clerk."Yes, sir," was the not clearly outspoken answer."Didn't Garland pay?""N-n-o, sir!" The suddenness of this question so confounded Martin,that he could not answer without a betraying hesitation."Martin!" Astonishment, rebuke, and accusation were in the voice ofMr. Phillips as he pronounced his clerk's name. Martin's faceflushed deeply, and then grew very pale. He stood the image of guiltand fear for some moments, then, drawing out his pocket book, hebrought therefrom a small roll of bank bills, and a memorandum slipof paper."I made these collections also." And he gave the money andmemorandum to Mr. Phillips."A hundred and fifty dollars withheld! Martin! Martin! what doesthis mean?""Heaven is my witness, sir," answered the young man, with quiveringlips, "that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had nointention of wronging you now. But I am in a fearful strait. My feethave become suddenly mired, and this was a desperate struggle forextrication--a temporary expedient only, not a premeditated wrongagainst you.""Sit down, Martin," said Mr. Phillips, in a grave, but not severe,tone of voice. "Let me understand the case from first to last.Conceal nothing, if you wish to have me for a friend."Thus enjoined, Martin told his humiliating story."If you had not gone into the way of temptation, the betrayer hadnot found you," was the remark of Mr. Phillips, when the young manended his confession. "Do you frequent these eating and drinkingsaloons?""I go occasionally, sir.""They are neither safe nor reputable, Martin. A young man whofrequents them must have the fine tone of his manhood dimmed. Thereis an atmosphere of impurity about these places. Have you a youngerbrother?""Yes, sir.""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth tomanhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?""No, sir, I would do all in my power to prevent it.""Why?""There's danger in them, sir.""And, knowing this, you went into the way of danger, and havefallen!"Martin dropped his eyes to the floor in confusion."Bland is a stool-pigeon and you were betrayed.""What am I to do?" asked the troubled young man. "I am in debt tohim.""He will be here to-morrow.""Yes, sir.""I will have a policeman ready to receive him.""O, no, no, Sir. Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself. I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth. One experiencelike this should last you a life-time."Thus Martin escaped from his dangerous entanglement, but never againto hold the unwavering confidence of his employer. Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green. He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; It's None of My Business It happened, very naturally, as Green was a bright, social youngman, that he made acquaintances with other young men, who werefrequently met in billiard saloons, theatre lobbies, and eatinghouses. Some of these he did not understand quite as well as heimagined. The vicious, who have ends to gain, know how to cloakthemselves, and easily deceive persons of Green's character. Among,these acquaintances was a handsome, gentlemanly, affable young man,named Bland, who gradually intruded himself into his confidence.Bland never drank to excess, and never seemed inclined to sensualindulgences. He had, moreover, a way of moralizing that completelyveiled his true quality from the not very penetrating Martin Green,whose shrewdness and knowledge of character were far less acute thanhe, in his self-conceit, imagined.One evening, instead of going with his sister to the house of afriend, where a select company of highly-intelligent ladies andgentleman were to meet, and pass an evening together, Martin excusedhimself under the pretence of an engagement, and lounged away to aneating and drinking saloon, there to spend an hour in smoking,reading the newspapers, and enjoying a glass of ale, the desire forwhich was fast growing into a habit. Strong and safe as he imaginedhimself, the very fact of preferring the atmosphere of a drinking orbilliard saloon to that in which refined and intellectual peoplebreathe, showed that he was weak and in danger.He was sitting with a cigar in his mouth, and a glass of ale besidehim, reading with the air of a man who felt entirely satisfied withhimself, and rather proud than ashamed of his position andsurroundings, when his pleasant friend, Mr. Bland, crossed the room,and, reaching out his hand, said, with his smiling, hearty manner,--"How are you, my friend? What's the news to-day?" And he drew achair to the table, calling at the same time to a waiter for a glassof ale."I never drink anything stronger than ale," he added, in aconfidential way, not waiting for Green to answer his first remark."Liquors are so drugged nowadays, that you never know what poisonyou are taking; besides, tippling is a bad habit, and sets aquestionable example. We must, you know, have some regard to theeffect of our conduct on weaker people. Man is an imitative animal.By the way, did you see Booth's Cardinal Wolsey?""Yes.""A splendid piece of acting,--was it not? You remember, after thecardinal's fall, that noble passage to which he gives utterance. Ithas been running through my mind ever since:--"'Mark but my fall,and that that ruined me.Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,The image of his Maker, hope to win by't?Love thyself last: Cherish those hearts that hate thee:Corruption wins not more than honesty.Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,To silence envious tongues; be just, and fear not.Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st, O Cromwell,Thou fall'st a blessed martyr.'"'Love thyself last.--Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thycountry's, thy God's, and truth's.' Could a man's whole duty in lifebe expressed in fewer words, or said more grandly? I think not."And so he went on, charming the ears of Green, and inspiring himwith the belief that he was a person of the purest instincts andnoblest ends. While they talked, two young men, strangers to Greencame up, and were introduced by Bland as "My very particularfriends." Something about them did not at first impress Martinfavorably. But this impression soon wore off, they were sointelligent and agreeable, Bland, after a little while, referredagain to the Cardinal Wolsey of Booth, and, drawing a copy ofShakspeare's Henry VIII. from his pocket, remarked,--"If it wasn't so public here, I'd like to read a few of the bestpassages in Wolsey's part.""Can't we get a private room?" said one of the two young men who hadjoined Bland and Green. "There are plenty in the house. I'll see."And away he went to the bar."Come," he said, returning in a few minutes; and the party followeda waiter up stairs, and were shown into a small room, neatlyfurnished, though smelling villanously of stale cigar smoke."This is cosy," was the approving remark of Bland, as they entered.Hats and overcoats were laid aside, and they drew around a tablethat stood in the centre of the room under the gaslight. A fewpassages were read from Shakspeare, then drink was ordered by one ofthe the party. The reading interspersed with critical comments, wasagain resumed; but the reading soon gave way entire to the comments,which, in a little while, passed from the text of Shakspeare toactors, actresses, prima donnas, and ballet-dancers, the relativemerits of which were knowingly discussed for some time. In the midstof this discussion, oysters, in two or three styles, and a smokingdish of terrapin, ordered by a member of the company--which our youngfriend Green did not know--were brought in, followed by a liberalsupply of wine and brandy. Bland expressed surprise, but acceptedthe entertainment as quite agreeable to himself.After the supper, cigars were introduced, and after the cigars,cards. A few games were played for shilling stakes. Green, under theinfluence of more liquor than his head could bear, and in the midstof companions whose sphere he could not, in consequence, resist,yielded in a new direction for him. Of gambling he had alwaysentertained a virtuous disapproval; yet, ere aware of the directionin which he was drifting, he was staking money at cards, the sumsgradually increasing, until from shillings the ventures increased todollars. Sometimes he won, and sometimes he lost; the winningsstimulating to new trials in the hope of further success, and thelosses stimulating to new trials in order to recover, if possible;but, steadily, the tide, for all these little eddies of success,bore him downwards, and losses increased from single dollars tofives, and from fives to tens, his pleasant friend, Bland, supplyingwhatever he wanted in the most disinterested way, until an aggregateloss of nearly a hundred and fifty dollars sobered and appalled him.The salary of Martin Green was only four hundred dollars, every centof which was expended as fast as earned. A loss of a hundred andfifty dollars was, therefore, a serious and embarrassing matter."I'll call and see you to-morrow, when we can arrange this littlematter," said Mr. Bland, "on parting with Green at his own door. Hespoke pleasantly, but with something in his voice that chilled thenerves of his victim. On the next day while Green stood at his desk,trying to fix his mind upon his work, and do it correctly, hisemployer said,--"Martin, there's a young man in the store who has asked for you."Green turned and saw the last man on the earth he desired to meet.His pleasant friend of the evening before had called to "arrangethat little matter.""Not too soon for you, I hope," remarked Bland, with his courteous,yet now serious, smile, as he took the victim's hand."Yes, you are, too soon," was soberly answered.The smile faded off of Bland's face."When will you arrange it?""In a few days.""But I want the money to-day. It was a simple loan, you know.""I am aware of that, but the amount is larger than I can manage atonce," said Green."Can I have a part to-day?""Not to-day.""To-morrow, then?""I'll do the best in my power.""Very well. To-morrow, at this time, I will call. Make up the wholesum if possible, for I want it badly.""Do you know that young man?" asked Mr. Phillips, the employer ofGreen, as the latter came back to his desk. The face of Mr. Phillipswas unusually serious."His name is Bland.""Why has he called to see you?" The eyes of Mr. Phillips were fixedintently on his clerk."He merely dropped in. I have met him a few times in company.""Don't you know his character?""I never heard a word against him," said Green."Why, Martin!" replied Mr. Phillips, "he has the reputation of beingone of the worst young men in our city; a base gambler'sstool-pigeon, some say.""I am glad to know it, sir," Martin had the presence of mind, in thepainful confusion that overwhelmed him, to say, "and shall treat himaccordingly." He went back to his desk, and resumed his work.It is the easiest thing in the world to go to astray, but alwaysdifficult to return, Martin Green was astray, but how was he to getinto the right path again? A barrier that seemed impassable was nowlying across the way over which he had passed, a little whilebefore, with lightest footsteps. Alone and unaided, he could notsafely get back. The evil spirits that lure a man from virtue nevercounsel aright when to seek to return. They magnify the perils thatbeset the road by which alone is safety, and suggest other ways thatlead into labyrinths of evil from which escape is sometimesimpossible. These spirits were now at the ear of our unhappy youngfriend, suggesting methods of relief in his embarrassing position.If Bland were indeed such a character as Mr. Phillips hadrepresented him, it would be ruin, in his employer's estimation, tohave him call again and again for his debt. But how was he toliquidate that debt?

This would enablehim to get rid of Bland, and gain time. So, acting upon the badsuggestion, he made up his return of collections, omitting the twoaccounts to which we have referred.Now it so happened that one of the persons against whom theseaccounts stood, met Mr. Phillips as he was returning from dinner inthe afternoon, and said to him,--"I settled that bill of yours to-day.""That's right. I wish all my customers were as punctual," answeredMr. Phillips."I gave your young man a check for a hundred and five dollars.""Thank you."And the two men passed their respective ways.On Mr. Phillips's return to his store, Martin rendered his accountof collections, and, to the surprise of his employer, omitted theone in regard to which he had just been notified."Is this all?" he asked, in a tone that sent a thrill of alarm tothe guilty heart of his clerk."Yes, sir," was the not clearly outspoken answer."Didn't Garland pay?""N-n-o, sir!" The suddenness of this question so confounded Martin,that he could not answer without a betraying hesitation."Martin!" Astonishment, rebuke, and accusation were in the voice ofMr. Phillips as he pronounced his clerk's name. Martin's faceflushed deeply, and then grew very pale. He stood the image of guiltand fear for some moments, then, drawing out his pocket book, hebrought therefrom a small roll of bank bills, and a memorandum slipof paper."I made these collections also." And he gave the money andmemorandum to Mr. Phillips."A hundred and fifty dollars withheld! Martin! Martin! what doesthis mean?""Heaven is my witness, sir," answered the young man, with quiveringlips, "that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had nointention of wronging you now. But I am in a fearful strait. My feethave become suddenly mired, and this was a desperate struggle forextrication--a temporary expedient only, not a premeditated wrongagainst you.""Sit down, Martin," said Mr. Phillips, in a grave, but not severe,tone of voice. "Let me understand the case from first to last.Conceal nothing, if you wish to have me for a friend."Thus enjoined, Martin told his humiliating story."If you had not gone into the way of temptation, the betrayer hadnot found you," was the remark of Mr. Phillips, when the young manended his confession. "Do you frequent these eating and drinkingsaloons?""I go occasionally, sir.""They are neither safe nor reputable, Martin. A young man whofrequents them must have the fine tone of his manhood dimmed. Thereis an atmosphere of impurity about these places. Have you a youngerbrother?""Yes, sir.""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth tomanhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?""No, sir, I would do all in my power to prevent it.""Why?""There's danger in them, sir.""And, knowing this, you went into the way of danger, and havefallen!"Martin dropped his eyes to the floor in confusion."Bland is a stool-pigeon and you were betrayed.""What am I to do?" asked the troubled young man. "I am in debt tohim.""He will be here to-morrow.""Yes, sir.""I will have a policeman ready to receive him.""O, no, no, Sir. Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself. I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth. One experiencelike this should last you a life-time."Thus Martin escaped from his dangerous entanglement, but never againto hold the unwavering confidence of his employer. Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green. He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; It's None of My Business He was sitting with a cigar in his mouth, and a glass of ale besidehim, reading with the air of a man who felt entirely satisfied withhimself, and rather proud than ashamed of his position andsurroundings, when his pleasant friend, Mr. Bland, crossed the room,and, reaching out his hand, said, with his smiling, hearty manner,--"How are you, my friend? What's the news to-day?" And he drew achair to the table, calling at the same time to a waiter for a glassof ale."I never drink anything stronger than ale," he added, in aconfidential way, not waiting for Green to answer his first remark."Liquors are so drugged nowadays, that you never know what poisonyou are taking; besides, tippling is a bad habit, and sets aquestionable example. We must, you know, have some regard to theeffect of our conduct on weaker people. Man is an imitative animal.By the way, did you see Booth's Cardinal Wolsey?""Yes.""A splendid piece of acting,--was it not? You remember, after thecardinal's fall, that noble passage to which he gives utterance. Ithas been running through my mind ever since:--"'Mark but my fall,and that that ruined me.Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,The image of his Maker, hope to win by't?Love thyself last: Cherish those hearts that hate thee:Corruption wins not more than honesty.Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,To silence envious tongues; be just, and fear not.Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st, O Cromwell,Thou fall'st a blessed martyr.'"'Love thyself last.--Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thycountry's, thy God's, and truth's.' Could a man's whole duty in lifebe expressed in fewer words, or said more grandly? I think not."And so he went on, charming the ears of Green, and inspiring himwith the belief that he was a person of the purest instincts andnoblest ends. While they talked, two young men, strangers to Greencame up, and were introduced by Bland as "My very particularfriends." Something about them did not at first impress Martinfavorably. But this impression soon wore off, they were sointelligent and agreeable, Bland, after a little while, referredagain to the Cardinal Wolsey of Booth, and, drawing a copy ofShakspeare's Henry VIII. from his pocket, remarked,--"If it wasn't so public here, I'd like to read a few of the bestpassages in Wolsey's part.""Can't we get a private room?" said one of the two young men who hadjoined Bland and Green. "There are plenty in the house. I'll see."And away he went to the bar."Come," he said, returning in a few minutes; and the party followeda waiter up stairs, and were shown into a small room, neatlyfurnished, though smelling villanously of stale cigar smoke."This is cosy," was the approving remark of Bland, as they entered.Hats and overcoats were laid aside, and they drew around a tablethat stood in the centre of the room under the gaslight. A fewpassages were read from Shakspeare, then drink was ordered by one ofthe the party. The reading interspersed with critical comments, wasagain resumed; but the reading soon gave way entire to the comments,which, in a little while, passed from the text of Shakspeare toactors, actresses, prima donnas, and ballet-dancers, the relativemerits of which were knowingly discussed for some time. In the midstof this discussion, oysters, in two or three styles, and a smokingdish of terrapin, ordered by a member of the company--which our youngfriend Green did not know--were brought in, followed by a liberalsupply of wine and brandy. Bland expressed surprise, but acceptedthe entertainment as quite agreeable to himself.After the supper, cigars were introduced, and after the cigars,cards. A few games were played for shilling stakes. Green, under theinfluence of more liquor than his head could bear, and in the midstof companions whose sphere he could not, in consequence, resist,yielded in a new direction for him. Of gambling he had alwaysentertained a virtuous disapproval; yet, ere aware of the directionin which he was drifting, he was staking money at cards, the sumsgradually increasing, until from shillings the ventures increased todollars. Sometimes he won, and sometimes he lost; the winningsstimulating to new trials in the hope of further success, and thelosses stimulating to new trials in order to recover, if possible;but, steadily, the tide, for all these little eddies of success,bore him downwards, and losses increased from single dollars tofives, and from fives to tens, his pleasant friend, Bland, supplyingwhatever he wanted in the most disinterested way, until an aggregateloss of nearly a hundred and fifty dollars sobered and appalled him.The salary of Martin Green was only four hundred dollars, every centof which was expended as fast as earned. A loss of a hundred andfifty dollars was, therefore, a serious and embarrassing matter."I'll call and see you to-morrow, when we can arrange this littlematter," said Mr. Bland, "on parting with Green at his own door. Hespoke pleasantly, but with something in his voice that chilled thenerves of his victim. On the next day while Green stood at his desk,trying to fix his mind upon his work, and do it correctly, hisemployer said,--"Martin, there's a young man in the store who has asked for you."Green turned and saw the last man on the earth he desired to meet.His pleasant friend of the evening before had called to "arrangethat little matter.""Not too soon for you, I hope," remarked Bland, with his courteous,yet now serious, smile, as he took the victim's hand."Yes, you are, too soon," was soberly answered.The smile faded off of Bland's face."When will you arrange it?""In a few days.""But I want the money to-day. It was a simple loan, you know.""I am aware of that, but the amount is larger than I can manage atonce," said Green."Can I have a part to-day?""Not to-day.""To-morrow, then?""I'll do the best in my power.""Very well. To-morrow, at this time, I will call. Make up the wholesum if possible, for I want it badly.""Do you know that young man?" asked Mr. Phillips, the employer ofGreen, as the latter came back to his desk. The face of Mr. Phillipswas unusually serious."His name is Bland.""Why has he called to see you?" The eyes of Mr. Phillips were fixedintently on his clerk."He merely dropped in. I have met him a few times in company.""Don't you know his character?""I never heard a word against him," said Green."Why, Martin!" replied Mr. Phillips, "he has the reputation of beingone of the worst young men in our city; a base gambler'sstool-pigeon, some say.""I am glad to know it, sir," Martin had the presence of mind, in thepainful confusion that overwhelmed him, to say, "and shall treat himaccordingly." He went back to his desk, and resumed his work.It is the easiest thing in the world to go to astray, but alwaysdifficult to return, Martin Green was astray, but how was he to getinto the right path again? A barrier that seemed impassable was nowlying across the way over which he had passed, a little whilebefore, with lightest footsteps. Alone and unaided, he could notsafely get back. The evil spirits that lure a man from virtue nevercounsel aright when to seek to return. They magnify the perils thatbeset the road by which alone is safety, and suggest other ways thatlead into labyrinths of evil from which escape is sometimesimpossible. These spirits were now at the ear of our unhappy youngfriend, suggesting methods of relief in his embarrassing position.If Bland were indeed such a character as Mr. Phillips hadrepresented him, it would be ruin, in his employer's estimation, tohave him call again and again for his debt. But how was he toliquidate that debt? There was nothing due him on account of salary,and there was not a friend or acquaintance to whom he could applywith any hope of borrowing."Man's extremity is the devil's opportunity." It was so in thepresent case, Green had a number of collections to make on that day,and his evil counsellors suggested his holding back the return oftwo of these, amounting to his indebtedness, and say that theparties were not yet ready to settle their bills.

Thereis an atmosphere of impurity about these places. Have you a youngerbrother?""Yes, sir.""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth tomanhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?""No, sir, I would do all in my power to prevent it.""Why?""There's danger in them, sir.""And, knowing this, you went into the way of danger, and havefallen!"Martin dropped his eyes to the floor in confusion."Bland is a stool-pigeon and you were betrayed.""What am I to do?" asked the troubled young man. "I am in debt tohim.""He will be here to-morrow.""Yes, sir.""I will have a policeman ready to receive him.""O, no, no, Sir. Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself. I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth. One experiencelike this should last you a life-time."Thus Martin escaped from his dangerous entanglement, but never againto hold the unwavering confidence of his employer. Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green. He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; It's None of My Business "I never drink anything stronger than ale," he added, in aconfidential way, not waiting for Green to answer his first remark."Liquors are so drugged nowadays, that you never know what poisonyou are taking; besides, tippling is a bad habit, and sets aquestionable example. We must, you know, have some regard to theeffect of our conduct on weaker people. Man is an imitative animal.By the way, did you see Booth's Cardinal Wolsey?""Yes.""A splendid piece of acting,--was it not? You remember, after thecardinal's fall, that noble passage to which he gives utterance. Ithas been running through my mind ever since:--"'Mark but my fall,and that that ruined me.Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,The image of his Maker, hope to win by't?Love thyself last: Cherish those hearts that hate thee:Corruption wins not more than honesty.Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,To silence envious tongues; be just, and fear not.Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st, O Cromwell,Thou fall'st a blessed martyr.'"'Love thyself last.--Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thycountry's, thy God's, and truth's.' Could a man's whole duty in lifebe expressed in fewer words, or said more grandly? I think not."And so he went on, charming the ears of Green, and inspiring himwith the belief that he was a person of the purest instincts andnoblest ends. While they talked, two young men, strangers to Greencame up, and were introduced by Bland as "My very particularfriends." Something about them did not at first impress Martinfavorably. But this impression soon wore off, they were sointelligent and agreeable, Bland, after a little while, referredagain to the Cardinal Wolsey of Booth, and, drawing a copy ofShakspeare's Henry VIII. from his pocket, remarked,--"If it wasn't so public here, I'd like to read a few of the bestpassages in Wolsey's part.""Can't we get a private room?" said one of the two young men who hadjoined Bland and Green. "There are plenty in the house. I'll see."And away he went to the bar."Come," he said, returning in a few minutes; and the party followeda waiter up stairs, and were shown into a small room, neatlyfurnished, though smelling villanously of stale cigar smoke."This is cosy," was the approving remark of Bland, as they entered.Hats and overcoats were laid aside, and they drew around a tablethat stood in the centre of the room under the gaslight. A fewpassages were read from Shakspeare, then drink was ordered by one ofthe the party. The reading interspersed with critical comments, wasagain resumed; but the reading soon gave way entire to the comments,which, in a little while, passed from the text of Shakspeare toactors, actresses, prima donnas, and ballet-dancers, the relativemerits of which were knowingly discussed for some time. In the midstof this discussion, oysters, in two or three styles, and a smokingdish of terrapin, ordered by a member of the company--which our youngfriend Green did not know--were brought in, followed by a liberalsupply of wine and brandy. Bland expressed surprise, but acceptedthe entertainment as quite agreeable to himself.After the supper, cigars were introduced, and after the cigars,cards. A few games were played for shilling stakes. Green, under theinfluence of more liquor than his head could bear, and in the midstof companions whose sphere he could not, in consequence, resist,yielded in a new direction for him. Of gambling he had alwaysentertained a virtuous disapproval; yet, ere aware of the directionin which he was drifting, he was staking money at cards, the sumsgradually increasing, until from shillings the ventures increased todollars. Sometimes he won, and sometimes he lost; the winningsstimulating to new trials in the hope of further success, and thelosses stimulating to new trials in order to recover, if possible;but, steadily, the tide, for all these little eddies of success,bore him downwards, and losses increased from single dollars tofives, and from fives to tens, his pleasant friend, Bland, supplyingwhatever he wanted in the most disinterested way, until an aggregateloss of nearly a hundred and fifty dollars sobered and appalled him.The salary of Martin Green was only four hundred dollars, every centof which was expended as fast as earned. A loss of a hundred andfifty dollars was, therefore, a serious and embarrassing matter."I'll call and see you to-morrow, when we can arrange this littlematter," said Mr. Bland, "on parting with Green at his own door. Hespoke pleasantly, but with something in his voice that chilled thenerves of his victim. On the next day while Green stood at his desk,trying to fix his mind upon his work, and do it correctly, hisemployer said,--"Martin, there's a young man in the store who has asked for you."Green turned and saw the last man on the earth he desired to meet.His pleasant friend of the evening before had called to "arrangethat little matter.""Not too soon for you, I hope," remarked Bland, with his courteous,yet now serious, smile, as he took the victim's hand."Yes, you are, too soon," was soberly answered.The smile faded off of Bland's face."When will you arrange it?""In a few days.""But I want the money to-day. It was a simple loan, you know.""I am aware of that, but the amount is larger than I can manage atonce," said Green."Can I have a part to-day?""Not to-day.""To-morrow, then?""I'll do the best in my power.""Very well. To-morrow, at this time, I will call. Make up the wholesum if possible, for I want it badly.""Do you know that young man?" asked Mr. Phillips, the employer ofGreen, as the latter came back to his desk. The face of Mr. Phillipswas unusually serious."His name is Bland.""Why has he called to see you?" The eyes of Mr. Phillips were fixedintently on his clerk."He merely dropped in. I have met him a few times in company.""Don't you know his character?""I never heard a word against him," said Green."Why, Martin!" replied Mr. Phillips, "he has the reputation of beingone of the worst young men in our city; a base gambler'sstool-pigeon, some say.""I am glad to know it, sir," Martin had the presence of mind, in thepainful confusion that overwhelmed him, to say, "and shall treat himaccordingly." He went back to his desk, and resumed his work.It is the easiest thing in the world to go to astray, but alwaysdifficult to return, Martin Green was astray, but how was he to getinto the right path again? A barrier that seemed impassable was nowlying across the way over which he had passed, a little whilebefore, with lightest footsteps. Alone and unaided, he could notsafely get back. The evil spirits that lure a man from virtue nevercounsel aright when to seek to return. They magnify the perils thatbeset the road by which alone is safety, and suggest other ways thatlead into labyrinths of evil from which escape is sometimesimpossible. These spirits were now at the ear of our unhappy youngfriend, suggesting methods of relief in his embarrassing position.If Bland were indeed such a character as Mr. Phillips hadrepresented him, it would be ruin, in his employer's estimation, tohave him call again and again for his debt. But how was he toliquidate that debt? There was nothing due him on account of salary,and there was not a friend or acquaintance to whom he could applywith any hope of borrowing."Man's extremity is the devil's opportunity." It was so in thepresent case, Green had a number of collections to make on that day,and his evil counsellors suggested his holding back the return oftwo of these, amounting to his indebtedness, and say that theparties were not yet ready to settle their bills. This would enablehim to get rid of Bland, and gain time. So, acting upon the badsuggestion, he made up his return of collections, omitting the twoaccounts to which we have referred.Now it so happened that one of the persons against whom theseaccounts stood, met Mr. Phillips as he was returning from dinner inthe afternoon, and said to him,--"I settled that bill of yours to-day.""That's right. I wish all my customers were as punctual," answeredMr. Phillips."I gave your young man a check for a hundred and five dollars.""Thank you."And the two men passed their respective ways.On Mr. Phillips's return to his store, Martin rendered his accountof collections, and, to the surprise of his employer, omitted theone in regard to which he had just been notified."Is this all?" he asked, in a tone that sent a thrill of alarm tothe guilty heart of his clerk."Yes, sir," was the not clearly outspoken answer."Didn't Garland pay?""N-n-o, sir!" The suddenness of this question so confounded Martin,that he could not answer without a betraying hesitation."Martin!" Astonishment, rebuke, and accusation were in the voice ofMr. Phillips as he pronounced his clerk's name. Martin's faceflushed deeply, and then grew very pale. He stood the image of guiltand fear for some moments, then, drawing out his pocket book, hebrought therefrom a small roll of bank bills, and a memorandum slipof paper."I made these collections also." And he gave the money andmemorandum to Mr. Phillips."A hundred and fifty dollars withheld! Martin! Martin! what doesthis mean?""Heaven is my witness, sir," answered the young man, with quiveringlips, "that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had nointention of wronging you now. But I am in a fearful strait. My feethave become suddenly mired, and this was a desperate struggle forextrication--a temporary expedient only, not a premeditated wrongagainst you.""Sit down, Martin," said Mr. Phillips, in a grave, but not severe,tone of voice. "Let me understand the case from first to last.Conceal nothing, if you wish to have me for a friend."Thus enjoined, Martin told his humiliating story."If you had not gone into the way of temptation, the betrayer hadnot found you," was the remark of Mr. Phillips, when the young manended his confession.

Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth. One experiencelike this should last you a life-time."Thus Martin escaped from his dangerous entanglement, but never againto hold the unwavering confidence of his employer. Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green. He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; It's None of My Business "A splendid piece of acting,--was it not? You remember, after thecardinal's fall, that noble passage to which he gives utterance. Ithas been running through my mind ever since:--"'Mark but my fall,and that that ruined me.Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,The image of his Maker, hope to win by't?Love thyself last: Cherish those hearts that hate thee:Corruption wins not more than honesty.Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,To silence envious tongues; be just, and fear not.Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st, O Cromwell,Thou fall'st a blessed martyr.'"'Love thyself last.--Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thycountry's, thy God's, and truth's.' Could a man's whole duty in lifebe expressed in fewer words, or said more grandly? I think not."And so he went on, charming the ears of Green, and inspiring himwith the belief that he was a person of the purest instincts andnoblest ends. While they talked, two young men, strangers to Greencame up, and were introduced by Bland as "My very particularfriends." Something about them did not at first impress Martinfavorably. But this impression soon wore off, they were sointelligent and agreeable, Bland, after a little while, referredagain to the Cardinal Wolsey of Booth, and, drawing a copy ofShakspeare's Henry VIII. from his pocket, remarked,--"If it wasn't so public here, I'd like to read a few of the bestpassages in Wolsey's part.""Can't we get a private room?" said one of the two young men who hadjoined Bland and Green. "There are plenty in the house. I'll see."And away he went to the bar."Come," he said, returning in a few minutes; and the party followeda waiter up stairs, and were shown into a small room, neatlyfurnished, though smelling villanously of stale cigar smoke."This is cosy," was the approving remark of Bland, as they entered.Hats and overcoats were laid aside, and they drew around a tablethat stood in the centre of the room under the gaslight. A fewpassages were read from Shakspeare, then drink was ordered by one ofthe the party. The reading interspersed with critical comments, wasagain resumed; but the reading soon gave way entire to the comments,which, in a little while, passed from the text of Shakspeare toactors, actresses, prima donnas, and ballet-dancers, the relativemerits of which were knowingly discussed for some time. In the midstof this discussion, oysters, in two or three styles, and a smokingdish of terrapin, ordered by a member of the company--which our youngfriend Green did not know--were brought in, followed by a liberalsupply of wine and brandy. Bland expressed surprise, but acceptedthe entertainment as quite agreeable to himself.After the supper, cigars were introduced, and after the cigars,cards. A few games were played for shilling stakes. Green, under theinfluence of more liquor than his head could bear, and in the midstof companions whose sphere he could not, in consequence, resist,yielded in a new direction for him. Of gambling he had alwaysentertained a virtuous disapproval; yet, ere aware of the directionin which he was drifting, he was staking money at cards, the sumsgradually increasing, until from shillings the ventures increased todollars. Sometimes he won, and sometimes he lost; the winningsstimulating to new trials in the hope of further success, and thelosses stimulating to new trials in order to recover, if possible;but, steadily, the tide, for all these little eddies of success,bore him downwards, and losses increased from single dollars tofives, and from fives to tens, his pleasant friend, Bland, supplyingwhatever he wanted in the most disinterested way, until an aggregateloss of nearly a hundred and fifty dollars sobered and appalled him.The salary of Martin Green was only four hundred dollars, every centof which was expended as fast as earned. A loss of a hundred andfifty dollars was, therefore, a serious and embarrassing matter."I'll call and see you to-morrow, when we can arrange this littlematter," said Mr. Bland, "on parting with Green at his own door. Hespoke pleasantly, but with something in his voice that chilled thenerves of his victim. On the next day while Green stood at his desk,trying to fix his mind upon his work, and do it correctly, hisemployer said,--"Martin, there's a young man in the store who has asked for you."Green turned and saw the last man on the earth he desired to meet.His pleasant friend of the evening before had called to "arrangethat little matter.""Not too soon for you, I hope," remarked Bland, with his courteous,yet now serious, smile, as he took the victim's hand."Yes, you are, too soon," was soberly answered.The smile faded off of Bland's face."When will you arrange it?""In a few days.""But I want the money to-day. It was a simple loan, you know.""I am aware of that, but the amount is larger than I can manage atonce," said Green."Can I have a part to-day?""Not to-day.""To-morrow, then?""I'll do the best in my power.""Very well. To-morrow, at this time, I will call. Make up the wholesum if possible, for I want it badly.""Do you know that young man?" asked Mr. Phillips, the employer ofGreen, as the latter came back to his desk. The face of Mr. Phillipswas unusually serious."His name is Bland.""Why has he called to see you?" The eyes of Mr. Phillips were fixedintently on his clerk."He merely dropped in. I have met him a few times in company.""Don't you know his character?""I never heard a word against him," said Green."Why, Martin!" replied Mr. Phillips, "he has the reputation of beingone of the worst young men in our city; a base gambler'sstool-pigeon, some say.""I am glad to know it, sir," Martin had the presence of mind, in thepainful confusion that overwhelmed him, to say, "and shall treat himaccordingly." He went back to his desk, and resumed his work.It is the easiest thing in the world to go to astray, but alwaysdifficult to return, Martin Green was astray, but how was he to getinto the right path again? A barrier that seemed impassable was nowlying across the way over which he had passed, a little whilebefore, with lightest footsteps. Alone and unaided, he could notsafely get back. The evil spirits that lure a man from virtue nevercounsel aright when to seek to return. They magnify the perils thatbeset the road by which alone is safety, and suggest other ways thatlead into labyrinths of evil from which escape is sometimesimpossible. These spirits were now at the ear of our unhappy youngfriend, suggesting methods of relief in his embarrassing position.If Bland were indeed such a character as Mr. Phillips hadrepresented him, it would be ruin, in his employer's estimation, tohave him call again and again for his debt. But how was he toliquidate that debt? There was nothing due him on account of salary,and there was not a friend or acquaintance to whom he could applywith any hope of borrowing."Man's extremity is the devil's opportunity." It was so in thepresent case, Green had a number of collections to make on that day,and his evil counsellors suggested his holding back the return oftwo of these, amounting to his indebtedness, and say that theparties were not yet ready to settle their bills. This would enablehim to get rid of Bland, and gain time. So, acting upon the badsuggestion, he made up his return of collections, omitting the twoaccounts to which we have referred.Now it so happened that one of the persons against whom theseaccounts stood, met Mr. Phillips as he was returning from dinner inthe afternoon, and said to him,--"I settled that bill of yours to-day.""That's right. I wish all my customers were as punctual," answeredMr. Phillips."I gave your young man a check for a hundred and five dollars.""Thank you."And the two men passed their respective ways.On Mr. Phillips's return to his store, Martin rendered his accountof collections, and, to the surprise of his employer, omitted theone in regard to which he had just been notified."Is this all?" he asked, in a tone that sent a thrill of alarm tothe guilty heart of his clerk."Yes, sir," was the not clearly outspoken answer."Didn't Garland pay?""N-n-o, sir!" The suddenness of this question so confounded Martin,that he could not answer without a betraying hesitation."Martin!" Astonishment, rebuke, and accusation were in the voice ofMr. Phillips as he pronounced his clerk's name. Martin's faceflushed deeply, and then grew very pale. He stood the image of guiltand fear for some moments, then, drawing out his pocket book, hebrought therefrom a small roll of bank bills, and a memorandum slipof paper."I made these collections also." And he gave the money andmemorandum to Mr. Phillips."A hundred and fifty dollars withheld! Martin! Martin! what doesthis mean?""Heaven is my witness, sir," answered the young man, with quiveringlips, "that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had nointention of wronging you now. But I am in a fearful strait. My feethave become suddenly mired, and this was a desperate struggle forextrication--a temporary expedient only, not a premeditated wrongagainst you.""Sit down, Martin," said Mr. Phillips, in a grave, but not severe,tone of voice. "Let me understand the case from first to last.Conceal nothing, if you wish to have me for a friend."Thus enjoined, Martin told his humiliating story."If you had not gone into the way of temptation, the betrayer hadnot found you," was the remark of Mr. Phillips, when the young manended his confession. "Do you frequent these eating and drinkingsaloons?""I go occasionally, sir.""They are neither safe nor reputable, Martin. A young man whofrequents them must have the fine tone of his manhood dimmed. Thereis an atmosphere of impurity about these places. Have you a youngerbrother?""Yes, sir.""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth tomanhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?""No, sir, I would do all in my power to prevent it.""Why?""There's danger in them, sir.""And, knowing this, you went into the way of danger, and havefallen!"Martin dropped his eyes to the floor in confusion."Bland is a stool-pigeon and you were betrayed.""What am I to do?" asked the troubled young man. "I am in debt tohim.""He will be here to-morrow.""Yes, sir.""I will have a policeman ready to receive him.""O, no, no, Sir. Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself. I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you.

A few games were played for shilling stakes. Green, under theinfluence of more liquor than his head could bear, and in the midstof companions whose sphere he could not, in consequence, resist,yielded in a new direction for him. Of gambling he had alwaysentertained a virtuous disapproval; yet, ere aware of the directionin which he was drifting, he was staking money at cards, the sumsgradually increasing, until from shillings the ventures increased todollars. Sometimes he won, and sometimes he lost; the winningsstimulating to new trials in the hope of further success, and thelosses stimulating to new trials in order to recover, if possible;but, steadily, the tide, for all these little eddies of success,bore him downwards, and losses increased from single dollars tofives, and from fives to tens, his pleasant friend, Bland, supplyingwhatever he wanted in the most disinterested way, until an aggregateloss of nearly a hundred and fifty dollars sobered and appalled him.The salary of Martin Green was only four hundred dollars, every centof which was expended as fast as earned. A loss of a hundred andfifty dollars was, therefore, a serious and embarrassing matter."I'll call and see you to-morrow, when we can arrange this littlematter," said Mr. Bland, "on parting with Green at his own door. Hespoke pleasantly, but with something in his voice that chilled thenerves of his victim. On the next day while Green stood at his desk,trying to fix his mind upon his work, and do it correctly, hisemployer said,--"Martin, there's a young man in the store who has asked for you."Green turned and saw the last man on the earth he desired to meet.His pleasant friend of the evening before had called to "arrangethat little matter.""Not too soon for you, I hope," remarked Bland, with his courteous,yet now serious, smile, as he took the victim's hand."Yes, you are, too soon," was soberly answered.The smile faded off of Bland's face."When will you arrange it?""In a few days.""But I want the money to-day. It was a simple loan, you know.""I am aware of that, but the amount is larger than I can manage atonce," said Green."Can I have a part to-day?""Not to-day.""To-morrow, then?""I'll do the best in my power.""Very well. To-morrow, at this time, I will call. Make up the wholesum if possible, for I want it badly.""Do you know that young man?" asked Mr. Phillips, the employer ofGreen, as the latter came back to his desk. The face of Mr. Phillipswas unusually serious."His name is Bland.""Why has he called to see you?" The eyes of Mr. Phillips were fixedintently on his clerk."He merely dropped in. I have met him a few times in company.""Don't you know his character?""I never heard a word against him," said Green."Why, Martin!" replied Mr. Phillips, "he has the reputation of beingone of the worst young men in our city; a base gambler'sstool-pigeon, some say.""I am glad to know it, sir," Martin had the presence of mind, in thepainful confusion that overwhelmed him, to say, "and shall treat himaccordingly." He went back to his desk, and resumed his work.It is the easiest thing in the world to go to astray, but alwaysdifficult to return, Martin Green was astray, but how was he to getinto the right path again? A barrier that seemed impassable was nowlying across the way over which he had passed, a little whilebefore, with lightest footsteps. Alone and unaided, he could notsafely get back. The evil spirits that lure a man from virtue nevercounsel aright when to seek to return. They magnify the perils thatbeset the road by which alone is safety, and suggest other ways thatlead into labyrinths of evil from which escape is sometimesimpossible. These spirits were now at the ear of our unhappy youngfriend, suggesting methods of relief in his embarrassing position.If Bland were indeed such a character as Mr. Phillips hadrepresented him, it would be ruin, in his employer's estimation, tohave him call again and again for his debt. But how was he toliquidate that debt? There was nothing due him on account of salary,and there was not a friend or acquaintance to whom he could applywith any hope of borrowing."Man's extremity is the devil's opportunity." It was so in thepresent case, Green had a number of collections to make on that day,and his evil counsellors suggested his holding back the return oftwo of these, amounting to his indebtedness, and say that theparties were not yet ready to settle their bills. This would enablehim to get rid of Bland, and gain time. So, acting upon the badsuggestion, he made up his return of collections, omitting the twoaccounts to which we have referred.Now it so happened that one of the persons against whom theseaccounts stood, met Mr. Phillips as he was returning from dinner inthe afternoon, and said to him,--"I settled that bill of yours to-day.""That's right. I wish all my customers were as punctual," answeredMr. Phillips."I gave your young man a check for a hundred and five dollars.""Thank you."And the two men passed their respective ways.On Mr. Phillips's return to his store, Martin rendered his accountof collections, and, to the surprise of his employer, omitted theone in regard to which he had just been notified."Is this all?" he asked, in a tone that sent a thrill of alarm tothe guilty heart of his clerk."Yes, sir," was the not clearly outspoken answer."Didn't Garland pay?""N-n-o, sir!" The suddenness of this question so confounded Martin,that he could not answer without a betraying hesitation."Martin!" Astonishment, rebuke, and accusation were in the voice ofMr. Phillips as he pronounced his clerk's name. Martin's faceflushed deeply, and then grew very pale. He stood the image of guiltand fear for some moments, then, drawing out his pocket book, hebrought therefrom a small roll of bank bills, and a memorandum slipof paper."I made these collections also." And he gave the money andmemorandum to Mr. Phillips."A hundred and fifty dollars withheld! Martin! Martin! what doesthis mean?""Heaven is my witness, sir," answered the young man, with quiveringlips, "that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had nointention of wronging you now. But I am in a fearful strait. My feethave become suddenly mired, and this was a desperate struggle forextrication--a temporary expedient only, not a premeditated wrongagainst you.""Sit down, Martin," said Mr. Phillips, in a grave, but not severe,tone of voice. "Let me understand the case from first to last.Conceal nothing, if you wish to have me for a friend."Thus enjoined, Martin told his humiliating story."If you had not gone into the way of temptation, the betrayer hadnot found you," was the remark of Mr. Phillips, when the young manended his confession. "Do you frequent these eating and drinkingsaloons?""I go occasionally, sir.""They are neither safe nor reputable, Martin. A young man whofrequents them must have the fine tone of his manhood dimmed. Thereis an atmosphere of impurity about these places. Have you a youngerbrother?""Yes, sir.""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth tomanhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?""No, sir, I would do all in my power to prevent it.""Why?""There's danger in them, sir.""And, knowing this, you went into the way of danger, and havefallen!"Martin dropped his eyes to the floor in confusion."Bland is a stool-pigeon and you were betrayed.""What am I to do?" asked the troubled young man. "I am in debt tohim.""He will be here to-morrow.""Yes, sir.""I will have a policeman ready to receive him.""O, no, no, Sir. Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself. I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth. One experiencelike this should last you a life-time."Thus Martin escaped from his dangerous entanglement, but never againto hold the unwavering confidence of his employer. Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green. He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; It's None of My Business The image of his Maker, hope to win by't?Love thyself last: Cherish those hearts that hate thee:Corruption wins not more than honesty.Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,To silence envious tongues; be just, and fear not.Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st, O Cromwell,Thou fall'st a blessed martyr.'"'Love thyself last.--Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thycountry's, thy God's, and truth's.' Could a man's whole duty in lifebe expressed in fewer words, or said more grandly? I think not."And so he went on, charming the ears of Green, and inspiring himwith the belief that he was a person of the purest instincts andnoblest ends. While they talked, two young men, strangers to Greencame up, and were introduced by Bland as "My very particularfriends." Something about them did not at first impress Martinfavorably. But this impression soon wore off, they were sointelligent and agreeable, Bland, after a little while, referredagain to the Cardinal Wolsey of Booth, and, drawing a copy ofShakspeare's Henry VIII. from his pocket, remarked,--"If it wasn't so public here, I'd like to read a few of the bestpassages in Wolsey's part.""Can't we get a private room?" said one of the two young men who hadjoined Bland and Green. "There are plenty in the house. I'll see."And away he went to the bar."Come," he said, returning in a few minutes; and the party followeda waiter up stairs, and were shown into a small room, neatlyfurnished, though smelling villanously of stale cigar smoke."This is cosy," was the approving remark of Bland, as they entered.Hats and overcoats were laid aside, and they drew around a tablethat stood in the centre of the room under the gaslight. A fewpassages were read from Shakspeare, then drink was ordered by one ofthe the party. The reading interspersed with critical comments, wasagain resumed; but the reading soon gave way entire to the comments,which, in a little while, passed from the text of Shakspeare toactors, actresses, prima donnas, and ballet-dancers, the relativemerits of which were knowingly discussed for some time. In the midstof this discussion, oysters, in two or three styles, and a smokingdish of terrapin, ordered by a member of the company--which our youngfriend Green did not know--were brought in, followed by a liberalsupply of wine and brandy.

I wish all my customers were as punctual," answeredMr. Phillips."I gave your young man a check for a hundred and five dollars.""Thank you."And the two men passed their respective ways.On Mr. Phillips's return to his store, Martin rendered his accountof collections, and, to the surprise of his employer, omitted theone in regard to which he had just been notified."Is this all?" he asked, in a tone that sent a thrill of alarm tothe guilty heart of his clerk."Yes, sir," was the not clearly outspoken answer."Didn't Garland pay?""N-n-o, sir!" The suddenness of this question so confounded Martin,that he could not answer without a betraying hesitation."Martin!" Astonishment, rebuke, and accusation were in the voice ofMr. Phillips as he pronounced his clerk's name. Martin's faceflushed deeply, and then grew very pale. He stood the image of guiltand fear for some moments, then, drawing out his pocket book, hebrought therefrom a small roll of bank bills, and a memorandum slipof paper."I made these collections also." And he gave the money andmemorandum to Mr. Phillips."A hundred and fifty dollars withheld! Martin! Martin! what doesthis mean?""Heaven is my witness, sir," answered the young man, with quiveringlips, "that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had nointention of wronging you now. But I am in a fearful strait. My feethave become suddenly mired, and this was a desperate struggle forextrication--a temporary expedient only, not a premeditated wrongagainst you.""Sit down, Martin," said Mr. Phillips, in a grave, but not severe,tone of voice. "Let me understand the case from first to last.Conceal nothing, if you wish to have me for a friend."Thus enjoined, Martin told his humiliating story."If you had not gone into the way of temptation, the betrayer hadnot found you," was the remark of Mr. Phillips, when the young manended his confession. "Do you frequent these eating and drinkingsaloons?""I go occasionally, sir.""They are neither safe nor reputable, Martin. A young man whofrequents them must have the fine tone of his manhood dimmed. Thereis an atmosphere of impurity about these places. Have you a youngerbrother?""Yes, sir.""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth tomanhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?""No, sir, I would do all in my power to prevent it.""Why?""There's danger in them, sir.""And, knowing this, you went into the way of danger, and havefallen!"Martin dropped his eyes to the floor in confusion."Bland is a stool-pigeon and you were betrayed.""What am I to do?" asked the troubled young man. "I am in debt tohim.""He will be here to-morrow.""Yes, sir.""I will have a policeman ready to receive him.""O, no, no, Sir. Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself. I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth. One experiencelike this should last you a life-time."Thus Martin escaped from his dangerous entanglement, but never againto hold the unwavering confidence of his employer. Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green. He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; It's None of My Business Corruption wins not more than honesty.Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,To silence envious tongues; be just, and fear not.Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st, O Cromwell,Thou fall'st a blessed martyr.'"'Love thyself last.--Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thycountry's, thy God's, and truth's.' Could a man's whole duty in lifebe expressed in fewer words, or said more grandly? I think not."And so he went on, charming the ears of Green, and inspiring himwith the belief that he was a person of the purest instincts andnoblest ends. While they talked, two young men, strangers to Greencame up, and were introduced by Bland as "My very particularfriends." Something about them did not at first impress Martinfavorably. But this impression soon wore off, they were sointelligent and agreeable, Bland, after a little while, referredagain to the Cardinal Wolsey of Booth, and, drawing a copy ofShakspeare's Henry VIII. from his pocket, remarked,--"If it wasn't so public here, I'd like to read a few of the bestpassages in Wolsey's part.""Can't we get a private room?" said one of the two young men who hadjoined Bland and Green. "There are plenty in the house. I'll see."And away he went to the bar."Come," he said, returning in a few minutes; and the party followeda waiter up stairs, and were shown into a small room, neatlyfurnished, though smelling villanously of stale cigar smoke."This is cosy," was the approving remark of Bland, as they entered.Hats and overcoats were laid aside, and they drew around a tablethat stood in the centre of the room under the gaslight. A fewpassages were read from Shakspeare, then drink was ordered by one ofthe the party. The reading interspersed with critical comments, wasagain resumed; but the reading soon gave way entire to the comments,which, in a little while, passed from the text of Shakspeare toactors, actresses, prima donnas, and ballet-dancers, the relativemerits of which were knowingly discussed for some time. In the midstof this discussion, oysters, in two or three styles, and a smokingdish of terrapin, ordered by a member of the company--which our youngfriend Green did not know--were brought in, followed by a liberalsupply of wine and brandy. Bland expressed surprise, but acceptedthe entertainment as quite agreeable to himself.After the supper, cigars were introduced, and after the cigars,cards. A few games were played for shilling stakes. Green, under theinfluence of more liquor than his head could bear, and in the midstof companions whose sphere he could not, in consequence, resist,yielded in a new direction for him. Of gambling he had alwaysentertained a virtuous disapproval; yet, ere aware of the directionin which he was drifting, he was staking money at cards, the sumsgradually increasing, until from shillings the ventures increased todollars. Sometimes he won, and sometimes he lost; the winningsstimulating to new trials in the hope of further success, and thelosses stimulating to new trials in order to recover, if possible;but, steadily, the tide, for all these little eddies of success,bore him downwards, and losses increased from single dollars tofives, and from fives to tens, his pleasant friend, Bland, supplyingwhatever he wanted in the most disinterested way, until an aggregateloss of nearly a hundred and fifty dollars sobered and appalled him.The salary of Martin Green was only four hundred dollars, every centof which was expended as fast as earned. A loss of a hundred andfifty dollars was, therefore, a serious and embarrassing matter."I'll call and see you to-morrow, when we can arrange this littlematter," said Mr. Bland, "on parting with Green at his own door. Hespoke pleasantly, but with something in his voice that chilled thenerves of his victim. On the next day while Green stood at his desk,trying to fix his mind upon his work, and do it correctly, hisemployer said,--"Martin, there's a young man in the store who has asked for you."Green turned and saw the last man on the earth he desired to meet.His pleasant friend of the evening before had called to "arrangethat little matter.""Not too soon for you, I hope," remarked Bland, with his courteous,yet now serious, smile, as he took the victim's hand."Yes, you are, too soon," was soberly answered.The smile faded off of Bland's face."When will you arrange it?""In a few days.""But I want the money to-day. It was a simple loan, you know.""I am aware of that, but the amount is larger than I can manage atonce," said Green."Can I have a part to-day?""Not to-day.""To-morrow, then?""I'll do the best in my power.""Very well. To-morrow, at this time, I will call. Make up the wholesum if possible, for I want it badly.""Do you know that young man?" asked Mr. Phillips, the employer ofGreen, as the latter came back to his desk. The face of Mr. Phillipswas unusually serious."His name is Bland.""Why has he called to see you?" The eyes of Mr. Phillips were fixedintently on his clerk."He merely dropped in. I have met him a few times in company.""Don't you know his character?""I never heard a word against him," said Green."Why, Martin!" replied Mr. Phillips, "he has the reputation of beingone of the worst young men in our city; a base gambler'sstool-pigeon, some say.""I am glad to know it, sir," Martin had the presence of mind, in thepainful confusion that overwhelmed him, to say, "and shall treat himaccordingly." He went back to his desk, and resumed his work.It is the easiest thing in the world to go to astray, but alwaysdifficult to return, Martin Green was astray, but how was he to getinto the right path again? A barrier that seemed impassable was nowlying across the way over which he had passed, a little whilebefore, with lightest footsteps. Alone and unaided, he could notsafely get back. The evil spirits that lure a man from virtue nevercounsel aright when to seek to return. They magnify the perils thatbeset the road by which alone is safety, and suggest other ways thatlead into labyrinths of evil from which escape is sometimesimpossible. These spirits were now at the ear of our unhappy youngfriend, suggesting methods of relief in his embarrassing position.If Bland were indeed such a character as Mr. Phillips hadrepresented him, it would be ruin, in his employer's estimation, tohave him call again and again for his debt. But how was he toliquidate that debt? There was nothing due him on account of salary,and there was not a friend or acquaintance to whom he could applywith any hope of borrowing."Man's extremity is the devil's opportunity." It was so in thepresent case, Green had a number of collections to make on that day,and his evil counsellors suggested his holding back the return oftwo of these, amounting to his indebtedness, and say that theparties were not yet ready to settle their bills. This would enablehim to get rid of Bland, and gain time. So, acting upon the badsuggestion, he made up his return of collections, omitting the twoaccounts to which we have referred.Now it so happened that one of the persons against whom theseaccounts stood, met Mr. Phillips as he was returning from dinner inthe afternoon, and said to him,--"I settled that bill of yours to-day.""That's right.

I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth. One experiencelike this should last you a life-time."Thus Martin escaped from his dangerous entanglement, but never againto hold the unwavering confidence of his employer. Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green. He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; It's None of My Business To silence envious tongues; be just, and fear not.Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st, O Cromwell,Thou fall'st a blessed martyr.'"'Love thyself last.--Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thycountry's, thy God's, and truth's.' Could a man's whole duty in lifebe expressed in fewer words, or said more grandly? I think not."And so he went on, charming the ears of Green, and inspiring himwith the belief that he was a person of the purest instincts andnoblest ends. While they talked, two young men, strangers to Greencame up, and were introduced by Bland as "My very particularfriends." Something about them did not at first impress Martinfavorably. But this impression soon wore off, they were sointelligent and agreeable, Bland, after a little while, referredagain to the Cardinal Wolsey of Booth, and, drawing a copy ofShakspeare's Henry VIII. from his pocket, remarked,--"If it wasn't so public here, I'd like to read a few of the bestpassages in Wolsey's part.""Can't we get a private room?" said one of the two young men who hadjoined Bland and Green. "There are plenty in the house. I'll see."And away he went to the bar."Come," he said, returning in a few minutes; and the party followeda waiter up stairs, and were shown into a small room, neatlyfurnished, though smelling villanously of stale cigar smoke."This is cosy," was the approving remark of Bland, as they entered.Hats and overcoats were laid aside, and they drew around a tablethat stood in the centre of the room under the gaslight. A fewpassages were read from Shakspeare, then drink was ordered by one ofthe the party. The reading interspersed with critical comments, wasagain resumed; but the reading soon gave way entire to the comments,which, in a little while, passed from the text of Shakspeare toactors, actresses, prima donnas, and ballet-dancers, the relativemerits of which were knowingly discussed for some time. In the midstof this discussion, oysters, in two or three styles, and a smokingdish of terrapin, ordered by a member of the company--which our youngfriend Green did not know--were brought in, followed by a liberalsupply of wine and brandy. Bland expressed surprise, but acceptedthe entertainment as quite agreeable to himself.After the supper, cigars were introduced, and after the cigars,cards. A few games were played for shilling stakes. Green, under theinfluence of more liquor than his head could bear, and in the midstof companions whose sphere he could not, in consequence, resist,yielded in a new direction for him. Of gambling he had alwaysentertained a virtuous disapproval; yet, ere aware of the directionin which he was drifting, he was staking money at cards, the sumsgradually increasing, until from shillings the ventures increased todollars. Sometimes he won, and sometimes he lost; the winningsstimulating to new trials in the hope of further success, and thelosses stimulating to new trials in order to recover, if possible;but, steadily, the tide, for all these little eddies of success,bore him downwards, and losses increased from single dollars tofives, and from fives to tens, his pleasant friend, Bland, supplyingwhatever he wanted in the most disinterested way, until an aggregateloss of nearly a hundred and fifty dollars sobered and appalled him.The salary of Martin Green was only four hundred dollars, every centof which was expended as fast as earned. A loss of a hundred andfifty dollars was, therefore, a serious and embarrassing matter."I'll call and see you to-morrow, when we can arrange this littlematter," said Mr. Bland, "on parting with Green at his own door. Hespoke pleasantly, but with something in his voice that chilled thenerves of his victim. On the next day while Green stood at his desk,trying to fix his mind upon his work, and do it correctly, hisemployer said,--"Martin, there's a young man in the store who has asked for you."Green turned and saw the last man on the earth he desired to meet.His pleasant friend of the evening before had called to "arrangethat little matter.""Not too soon for you, I hope," remarked Bland, with his courteous,yet now serious, smile, as he took the victim's hand."Yes, you are, too soon," was soberly answered.The smile faded off of Bland's face."When will you arrange it?""In a few days.""But I want the money to-day. It was a simple loan, you know.""I am aware of that, but the amount is larger than I can manage atonce," said Green."Can I have a part to-day?""Not to-day.""To-morrow, then?""I'll do the best in my power.""Very well. To-morrow, at this time, I will call. Make up the wholesum if possible, for I want it badly.""Do you know that young man?" asked Mr. Phillips, the employer ofGreen, as the latter came back to his desk. The face of Mr. Phillipswas unusually serious."His name is Bland.""Why has he called to see you?" The eyes of Mr. Phillips were fixedintently on his clerk."He merely dropped in. I have met him a few times in company.""Don't you know his character?""I never heard a word against him," said Green."Why, Martin!" replied Mr. Phillips, "he has the reputation of beingone of the worst young men in our city; a base gambler'sstool-pigeon, some say.""I am glad to know it, sir," Martin had the presence of mind, in thepainful confusion that overwhelmed him, to say, "and shall treat himaccordingly." He went back to his desk, and resumed his work.It is the easiest thing in the world to go to astray, but alwaysdifficult to return, Martin Green was astray, but how was he to getinto the right path again? A barrier that seemed impassable was nowlying across the way over which he had passed, a little whilebefore, with lightest footsteps. Alone and unaided, he could notsafely get back. The evil spirits that lure a man from virtue nevercounsel aright when to seek to return. They magnify the perils thatbeset the road by which alone is safety, and suggest other ways thatlead into labyrinths of evil from which escape is sometimesimpossible. These spirits were now at the ear of our unhappy youngfriend, suggesting methods of relief in his embarrassing position.If Bland were indeed such a character as Mr. Phillips hadrepresented him, it would be ruin, in his employer's estimation, tohave him call again and again for his debt. But how was he toliquidate that debt? There was nothing due him on account of salary,and there was not a friend or acquaintance to whom he could applywith any hope of borrowing."Man's extremity is the devil's opportunity." It was so in thepresent case, Green had a number of collections to make on that day,and his evil counsellors suggested his holding back the return oftwo of these, amounting to his indebtedness, and say that theparties were not yet ready to settle their bills. This would enablehim to get rid of Bland, and gain time. So, acting upon the badsuggestion, he made up his return of collections, omitting the twoaccounts to which we have referred.Now it so happened that one of the persons against whom theseaccounts stood, met Mr. Phillips as he was returning from dinner inthe afternoon, and said to him,--"I settled that bill of yours to-day.""That's right. I wish all my customers were as punctual," answeredMr. Phillips."I gave your young man a check for a hundred and five dollars.""Thank you."And the two men passed their respective ways.On Mr. Phillips's return to his store, Martin rendered his accountof collections, and, to the surprise of his employer, omitted theone in regard to which he had just been notified."Is this all?" he asked, in a tone that sent a thrill of alarm tothe guilty heart of his clerk."Yes, sir," was the not clearly outspoken answer."Didn't Garland pay?""N-n-o, sir!" The suddenness of this question so confounded Martin,that he could not answer without a betraying hesitation."Martin!" Astonishment, rebuke, and accusation were in the voice ofMr. Phillips as he pronounced his clerk's name. Martin's faceflushed deeply, and then grew very pale. He stood the image of guiltand fear for some moments, then, drawing out his pocket book, hebrought therefrom a small roll of bank bills, and a memorandum slipof paper."I made these collections also." And he gave the money andmemorandum to Mr. Phillips."A hundred and fifty dollars withheld! Martin! Martin! what doesthis mean?""Heaven is my witness, sir," answered the young man, with quiveringlips, "that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had nointention of wronging you now. But I am in a fearful strait. My feethave become suddenly mired, and this was a desperate struggle forextrication--a temporary expedient only, not a premeditated wrongagainst you.""Sit down, Martin," said Mr. Phillips, in a grave, but not severe,tone of voice. "Let me understand the case from first to last.Conceal nothing, if you wish to have me for a friend."Thus enjoined, Martin told his humiliating story."If you had not gone into the way of temptation, the betrayer hadnot found you," was the remark of Mr. Phillips, when the young manended his confession. "Do you frequent these eating and drinkingsaloons?""I go occasionally, sir.""They are neither safe nor reputable, Martin. A young man whofrequents them must have the fine tone of his manhood dimmed. Thereis an atmosphere of impurity about these places. Have you a youngerbrother?""Yes, sir.""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth tomanhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?""No, sir, I would do all in my power to prevent it.""Why?""There's danger in them, sir.""And, knowing this, you went into the way of danger, and havefallen!"Martin dropped his eyes to the floor in confusion."Bland is a stool-pigeon and you were betrayed.""What am I to do?" asked the troubled young man. "I am in debt tohim.""He will be here to-morrow.""Yes, sir.""I will have a policeman ready to receive him.""O, no, no, Sir. Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself. I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you.

Sometimes he won, and sometimes he lost; the winningsstimulating to new trials in the hope of further success, and thelosses stimulating to new trials in order to recover, if possible;but, steadily, the tide, for all these little eddies of success,bore him downwards, and losses increased from single dollars tofives, and from fives to tens, his pleasant friend, Bland, supplyingwhatever he wanted in the most disinterested way, until an aggregateloss of nearly a hundred and fifty dollars sobered and appalled him.The salary of Martin Green was only four hundred dollars, every centof which was expended as fast as earned. A loss of a hundred andfifty dollars was, therefore, a serious and embarrassing matter."I'll call and see you to-morrow, when we can arrange this littlematter," said Mr. Bland, "on parting with Green at his own door. Hespoke pleasantly, but with something in his voice that chilled thenerves of his victim. On the next day while Green stood at his desk,trying to fix his mind upon his work, and do it correctly, hisemployer said,--"Martin, there's a young man in the store who has asked for you."Green turned and saw the last man on the earth he desired to meet.His pleasant friend of the evening before had called to "arrangethat little matter.""Not too soon for you, I hope," remarked Bland, with his courteous,yet now serious, smile, as he took the victim's hand."Yes, you are, too soon," was soberly answered.The smile faded off of Bland's face."When will you arrange it?""In a few days.""But I want the money to-day. It was a simple loan, you know.""I am aware of that, but the amount is larger than I can manage atonce," said Green."Can I have a part to-day?""Not to-day.""To-morrow, then?""I'll do the best in my power.""Very well. To-morrow, at this time, I will call. Make up the wholesum if possible, for I want it badly.""Do you know that young man?" asked Mr. Phillips, the employer ofGreen, as the latter came back to his desk. The face of Mr. Phillipswas unusually serious."His name is Bland.""Why has he called to see you?" The eyes of Mr. Phillips were fixedintently on his clerk."He merely dropped in. I have met him a few times in company.""Don't you know his character?""I never heard a word against him," said Green."Why, Martin!" replied Mr. Phillips, "he has the reputation of beingone of the worst young men in our city; a base gambler'sstool-pigeon, some say.""I am glad to know it, sir," Martin had the presence of mind, in thepainful confusion that overwhelmed him, to say, "and shall treat himaccordingly." He went back to his desk, and resumed his work.It is the easiest thing in the world to go to astray, but alwaysdifficult to return, Martin Green was astray, but how was he to getinto the right path again? A barrier that seemed impassable was nowlying across the way over which he had passed, a little whilebefore, with lightest footsteps. Alone and unaided, he could notsafely get back. The evil spirits that lure a man from virtue nevercounsel aright when to seek to return. They magnify the perils thatbeset the road by which alone is safety, and suggest other ways thatlead into labyrinths of evil from which escape is sometimesimpossible. These spirits were now at the ear of our unhappy youngfriend, suggesting methods of relief in his embarrassing position.If Bland were indeed such a character as Mr. Phillips hadrepresented him, it would be ruin, in his employer's estimation, tohave him call again and again for his debt. But how was he toliquidate that debt? There was nothing due him on account of salary,and there was not a friend or acquaintance to whom he could applywith any hope of borrowing."Man's extremity is the devil's opportunity." It was so in thepresent case, Green had a number of collections to make on that day,and his evil counsellors suggested his holding back the return oftwo of these, amounting to his indebtedness, and say that theparties were not yet ready to settle their bills. This would enablehim to get rid of Bland, and gain time. So, acting upon the badsuggestion, he made up his return of collections, omitting the twoaccounts to which we have referred.Now it so happened that one of the persons against whom theseaccounts stood, met Mr. Phillips as he was returning from dinner inthe afternoon, and said to him,--"I settled that bill of yours to-day.""That's right. I wish all my customers were as punctual," answeredMr. Phillips."I gave your young man a check for a hundred and five dollars.""Thank you."And the two men passed their respective ways.On Mr. Phillips's return to his store, Martin rendered his accountof collections, and, to the surprise of his employer, omitted theone in regard to which he had just been notified."Is this all?" he asked, in a tone that sent a thrill of alarm tothe guilty heart of his clerk."Yes, sir," was the not clearly outspoken answer."Didn't Garland pay?""N-n-o, sir!" The suddenness of this question so confounded Martin,that he could not answer without a betraying hesitation."Martin!" Astonishment, rebuke, and accusation were in the voice ofMr. Phillips as he pronounced his clerk's name. Martin's faceflushed deeply, and then grew very pale. He stood the image of guiltand fear for some moments, then, drawing out his pocket book, hebrought therefrom a small roll of bank bills, and a memorandum slipof paper."I made these collections also." And he gave the money andmemorandum to Mr. Phillips."A hundred and fifty dollars withheld! Martin! Martin! what doesthis mean?""Heaven is my witness, sir," answered the young man, with quiveringlips, "that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had nointention of wronging you now. But I am in a fearful strait. My feethave become suddenly mired, and this was a desperate struggle forextrication--a temporary expedient only, not a premeditated wrongagainst you.""Sit down, Martin," said Mr. Phillips, in a grave, but not severe,tone of voice. "Let me understand the case from first to last.Conceal nothing, if you wish to have me for a friend."Thus enjoined, Martin told his humiliating story."If you had not gone into the way of temptation, the betrayer hadnot found you," was the remark of Mr. Phillips, when the young manended his confession. "Do you frequent these eating and drinkingsaloons?""I go occasionally, sir.""They are neither safe nor reputable, Martin. A young man whofrequents them must have the fine tone of his manhood dimmed. Thereis an atmosphere of impurity about these places. Have you a youngerbrother?""Yes, sir.""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth tomanhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?""No, sir, I would do all in my power to prevent it.""Why?""There's danger in them, sir.""And, knowing this, you went into the way of danger, and havefallen!"Martin dropped his eyes to the floor in confusion."Bland is a stool-pigeon and you were betrayed.""What am I to do?" asked the troubled young man. "I am in debt tohim.""He will be here to-morrow.""Yes, sir.""I will have a policeman ready to receive him.""O, no, no, Sir. Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself. I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth. One experiencelike this should last you a life-time."Thus Martin escaped from his dangerous entanglement, but never againto hold the unwavering confidence of his employer. Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green. He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; It's None of My Business Thou fall'st a blessed martyr.'"'Love thyself last.--Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thycountry's, thy God's, and truth's.' Could a man's whole duty in lifebe expressed in fewer words, or said more grandly? I think not."And so he went on, charming the ears of Green, and inspiring himwith the belief that he was a person of the purest instincts andnoblest ends. While they talked, two young men, strangers to Greencame up, and were introduced by Bland as "My very particularfriends." Something about them did not at first impress Martinfavorably. But this impression soon wore off, they were sointelligent and agreeable, Bland, after a little while, referredagain to the Cardinal Wolsey of Booth, and, drawing a copy ofShakspeare's Henry VIII. from his pocket, remarked,--"If it wasn't so public here, I'd like to read a few of the bestpassages in Wolsey's part.""Can't we get a private room?" said one of the two young men who hadjoined Bland and Green. "There are plenty in the house. I'll see."And away he went to the bar."Come," he said, returning in a few minutes; and the party followeda waiter up stairs, and were shown into a small room, neatlyfurnished, though smelling villanously of stale cigar smoke."This is cosy," was the approving remark of Bland, as they entered.Hats and overcoats were laid aside, and they drew around a tablethat stood in the centre of the room under the gaslight. A fewpassages were read from Shakspeare, then drink was ordered by one ofthe the party. The reading interspersed with critical comments, wasagain resumed; but the reading soon gave way entire to the comments,which, in a little while, passed from the text of Shakspeare toactors, actresses, prima donnas, and ballet-dancers, the relativemerits of which were knowingly discussed for some time. In the midstof this discussion, oysters, in two or three styles, and a smokingdish of terrapin, ordered by a member of the company--which our youngfriend Green did not know--were brought in, followed by a liberalsupply of wine and brandy. Bland expressed surprise, but acceptedthe entertainment as quite agreeable to himself.After the supper, cigars were introduced, and after the cigars,cards. A few games were played for shilling stakes. Green, under theinfluence of more liquor than his head could bear, and in the midstof companions whose sphere he could not, in consequence, resist,yielded in a new direction for him. Of gambling he had alwaysentertained a virtuous disapproval; yet, ere aware of the directionin which he was drifting, he was staking money at cards, the sumsgradually increasing, until from shillings the ventures increased todollars.

Martin! what doesthis mean?""Heaven is my witness, sir," answered the young man, with quiveringlips, "that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had nointention of wronging you now. But I am in a fearful strait. My feethave become suddenly mired, and this was a desperate struggle forextrication--a temporary expedient only, not a premeditated wrongagainst you.""Sit down, Martin," said Mr. Phillips, in a grave, but not severe,tone of voice. "Let me understand the case from first to last.Conceal nothing, if you wish to have me for a friend."Thus enjoined, Martin told his humiliating story."If you had not gone into the way of temptation, the betrayer hadnot found you," was the remark of Mr. Phillips, when the young manended his confession. "Do you frequent these eating and drinkingsaloons?""I go occasionally, sir.""They are neither safe nor reputable, Martin. A young man whofrequents them must have the fine tone of his manhood dimmed. Thereis an atmosphere of impurity about these places. Have you a youngerbrother?""Yes, sir.""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth tomanhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?""No, sir, I would do all in my power to prevent it.""Why?""There's danger in them, sir.""And, knowing this, you went into the way of danger, and havefallen!"Martin dropped his eyes to the floor in confusion."Bland is a stool-pigeon and you were betrayed.""What am I to do?" asked the troubled young man. "I am in debt tohim.""He will be here to-morrow.""Yes, sir.""I will have a policeman ready to receive him.""O, no, no, Sir. Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself. I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth. One experiencelike this should last you a life-time."Thus Martin escaped from his dangerous entanglement, but never againto hold the unwavering confidence of his employer. Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green. He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; It's None of My Business And so he went on, charming the ears of Green, and inspiring himwith the belief that he was a person of the purest instincts andnoblest ends. While they talked, two young men, strangers to Greencame up, and were introduced by Bland as "My very particularfriends." Something about them did not at first impress Martinfavorably. But this impression soon wore off, they were sointelligent and agreeable, Bland, after a little while, referredagain to the Cardinal Wolsey of Booth, and, drawing a copy ofShakspeare's Henry VIII. from his pocket, remarked,--"If it wasn't so public here, I'd like to read a few of the bestpassages in Wolsey's part.""Can't we get a private room?" said one of the two young men who hadjoined Bland and Green. "There are plenty in the house. I'll see."And away he went to the bar."Come," he said, returning in a few minutes; and the party followeda waiter up stairs, and were shown into a small room, neatlyfurnished, though smelling villanously of stale cigar smoke."This is cosy," was the approving remark of Bland, as they entered.Hats and overcoats were laid aside, and they drew around a tablethat stood in the centre of the room under the gaslight. A fewpassages were read from Shakspeare, then drink was ordered by one ofthe the party. The reading interspersed with critical comments, wasagain resumed; but the reading soon gave way entire to the comments,which, in a little while, passed from the text of Shakspeare toactors, actresses, prima donnas, and ballet-dancers, the relativemerits of which were knowingly discussed for some time. In the midstof this discussion, oysters, in two or three styles, and a smokingdish of terrapin, ordered by a member of the company--which our youngfriend Green did not know--were brought in, followed by a liberalsupply of wine and brandy. Bland expressed surprise, but acceptedthe entertainment as quite agreeable to himself.After the supper, cigars were introduced, and after the cigars,cards. A few games were played for shilling stakes. Green, under theinfluence of more liquor than his head could bear, and in the midstof companions whose sphere he could not, in consequence, resist,yielded in a new direction for him. Of gambling he had alwaysentertained a virtuous disapproval; yet, ere aware of the directionin which he was drifting, he was staking money at cards, the sumsgradually increasing, until from shillings the ventures increased todollars. Sometimes he won, and sometimes he lost; the winningsstimulating to new trials in the hope of further success, and thelosses stimulating to new trials in order to recover, if possible;but, steadily, the tide, for all these little eddies of success,bore him downwards, and losses increased from single dollars tofives, and from fives to tens, his pleasant friend, Bland, supplyingwhatever he wanted in the most disinterested way, until an aggregateloss of nearly a hundred and fifty dollars sobered and appalled him.The salary of Martin Green was only four hundred dollars, every centof which was expended as fast as earned. A loss of a hundred andfifty dollars was, therefore, a serious and embarrassing matter."I'll call and see you to-morrow, when we can arrange this littlematter," said Mr. Bland, "on parting with Green at his own door. Hespoke pleasantly, but with something in his voice that chilled thenerves of his victim. On the next day while Green stood at his desk,trying to fix his mind upon his work, and do it correctly, hisemployer said,--"Martin, there's a young man in the store who has asked for you."Green turned and saw the last man on the earth he desired to meet.His pleasant friend of the evening before had called to "arrangethat little matter.""Not too soon for you, I hope," remarked Bland, with his courteous,yet now serious, smile, as he took the victim's hand."Yes, you are, too soon," was soberly answered.The smile faded off of Bland's face."When will you arrange it?""In a few days.""But I want the money to-day. It was a simple loan, you know.""I am aware of that, but the amount is larger than I can manage atonce," said Green."Can I have a part to-day?""Not to-day.""To-morrow, then?""I'll do the best in my power.""Very well. To-morrow, at this time, I will call. Make up the wholesum if possible, for I want it badly.""Do you know that young man?" asked Mr. Phillips, the employer ofGreen, as the latter came back to his desk. The face of Mr. Phillipswas unusually serious."His name is Bland.""Why has he called to see you?" The eyes of Mr. Phillips were fixedintently on his clerk."He merely dropped in. I have met him a few times in company.""Don't you know his character?""I never heard a word against him," said Green."Why, Martin!" replied Mr. Phillips, "he has the reputation of beingone of the worst young men in our city; a base gambler'sstool-pigeon, some say.""I am glad to know it, sir," Martin had the presence of mind, in thepainful confusion that overwhelmed him, to say, "and shall treat himaccordingly." He went back to his desk, and resumed his work.It is the easiest thing in the world to go to astray, but alwaysdifficult to return, Martin Green was astray, but how was he to getinto the right path again? A barrier that seemed impassable was nowlying across the way over which he had passed, a little whilebefore, with lightest footsteps. Alone and unaided, he could notsafely get back. The evil spirits that lure a man from virtue nevercounsel aright when to seek to return. They magnify the perils thatbeset the road by which alone is safety, and suggest other ways thatlead into labyrinths of evil from which escape is sometimesimpossible. These spirits were now at the ear of our unhappy youngfriend, suggesting methods of relief in his embarrassing position.If Bland were indeed such a character as Mr. Phillips hadrepresented him, it would be ruin, in his employer's estimation, tohave him call again and again for his debt. But how was he toliquidate that debt? There was nothing due him on account of salary,and there was not a friend or acquaintance to whom he could applywith any hope of borrowing."Man's extremity is the devil's opportunity." It was so in thepresent case, Green had a number of collections to make on that day,and his evil counsellors suggested his holding back the return oftwo of these, amounting to his indebtedness, and say that theparties were not yet ready to settle their bills. This would enablehim to get rid of Bland, and gain time. So, acting upon the badsuggestion, he made up his return of collections, omitting the twoaccounts to which we have referred.Now it so happened that one of the persons against whom theseaccounts stood, met Mr. Phillips as he was returning from dinner inthe afternoon, and said to him,--"I settled that bill of yours to-day.""That's right. I wish all my customers were as punctual," answeredMr. Phillips."I gave your young man a check for a hundred and five dollars.""Thank you."And the two men passed their respective ways.On Mr. Phillips's return to his store, Martin rendered his accountof collections, and, to the surprise of his employer, omitted theone in regard to which he had just been notified."Is this all?" he asked, in a tone that sent a thrill of alarm tothe guilty heart of his clerk."Yes, sir," was the not clearly outspoken answer."Didn't Garland pay?""N-n-o, sir!" The suddenness of this question so confounded Martin,that he could not answer without a betraying hesitation."Martin!" Astonishment, rebuke, and accusation were in the voice ofMr. Phillips as he pronounced his clerk's name. Martin's faceflushed deeply, and then grew very pale. He stood the image of guiltand fear for some moments, then, drawing out his pocket book, hebrought therefrom a small roll of bank bills, and a memorandum slipof paper."I made these collections also." And he gave the money andmemorandum to Mr. Phillips."A hundred and fifty dollars withheld! Martin! Martin! what doesthis mean?""Heaven is my witness, sir," answered the young man, with quiveringlips, "that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had nointention of wronging you now. But I am in a fearful strait. My feethave become suddenly mired, and this was a desperate struggle forextrication--a temporary expedient only, not a premeditated wrongagainst you.""Sit down, Martin," said Mr. Phillips, in a grave, but not severe,tone of voice.

The reading interspersed with critical comments, wasagain resumed; but the reading soon gave way entire to the comments,which, in a little while, passed from the text of Shakspeare toactors, actresses, prima donnas, and ballet-dancers, the relativemerits of which were knowingly discussed for some time. In the midstof this discussion, oysters, in two or three styles, and a smokingdish of terrapin, ordered by a member of the company--which our youngfriend Green did not know--were brought in, followed by a liberalsupply of wine and brandy. Bland expressed surprise, but acceptedthe entertainment as quite agreeable to himself.After the supper, cigars were introduced, and after the cigars,cards. A few games were played for shilling stakes. Green, under theinfluence of more liquor than his head could bear, and in the midstof companions whose sphere he could not, in consequence, resist,yielded in a new direction for him. Of gambling he had alwaysentertained a virtuous disapproval; yet, ere aware of the directionin which he was drifting, he was staking money at cards, the sumsgradually increasing, until from shillings the ventures increased todollars. Sometimes he won, and sometimes he lost; the winningsstimulating to new trials in the hope of further success, and thelosses stimulating to new trials in order to recover, if possible;but, steadily, the tide, for all these little eddies of success,bore him downwards, and losses increased from single dollars tofives, and from fives to tens, his pleasant friend, Bland, supplyingwhatever he wanted in the most disinterested way, until an aggregateloss of nearly a hundred and fifty dollars sobered and appalled him.The salary of Martin Green was only four hundred dollars, every centof which was expended as fast as earned. A loss of a hundred andfifty dollars was, therefore, a serious and embarrassing matter."I'll call and see you to-morrow, when we can arrange this littlematter," said Mr. Bland, "on parting with Green at his own door. Hespoke pleasantly, but with something in his voice that chilled thenerves of his victim. On the next day while Green stood at his desk,trying to fix his mind upon his work, and do it correctly, hisemployer said,--"Martin, there's a young man in the store who has asked for you."Green turned and saw the last man on the earth he desired to meet.His pleasant friend of the evening before had called to "arrangethat little matter.""Not too soon for you, I hope," remarked Bland, with his courteous,yet now serious, smile, as he took the victim's hand."Yes, you are, too soon," was soberly answered.The smile faded off of Bland's face."When will you arrange it?""In a few days.""But I want the money to-day. It was a simple loan, you know.""I am aware of that, but the amount is larger than I can manage atonce," said Green."Can I have a part to-day?""Not to-day.""To-morrow, then?""I'll do the best in my power.""Very well. To-morrow, at this time, I will call. Make up the wholesum if possible, for I want it badly.""Do you know that young man?" asked Mr. Phillips, the employer ofGreen, as the latter came back to his desk. The face of Mr. Phillipswas unusually serious."His name is Bland.""Why has he called to see you?" The eyes of Mr. Phillips were fixedintently on his clerk."He merely dropped in. I have met him a few times in company.""Don't you know his character?""I never heard a word against him," said Green."Why, Martin!" replied Mr. Phillips, "he has the reputation of beingone of the worst young men in our city; a base gambler'sstool-pigeon, some say.""I am glad to know it, sir," Martin had the presence of mind, in thepainful confusion that overwhelmed him, to say, "and shall treat himaccordingly." He went back to his desk, and resumed his work.It is the easiest thing in the world to go to astray, but alwaysdifficult to return, Martin Green was astray, but how was he to getinto the right path again? A barrier that seemed impassable was nowlying across the way over which he had passed, a little whilebefore, with lightest footsteps. Alone and unaided, he could notsafely get back. The evil spirits that lure a man from virtue nevercounsel aright when to seek to return. They magnify the perils thatbeset the road by which alone is safety, and suggest other ways thatlead into labyrinths of evil from which escape is sometimesimpossible. These spirits were now at the ear of our unhappy youngfriend, suggesting methods of relief in his embarrassing position.If Bland were indeed such a character as Mr. Phillips hadrepresented him, it would be ruin, in his employer's estimation, tohave him call again and again for his debt. But how was he toliquidate that debt? There was nothing due him on account of salary,and there was not a friend or acquaintance to whom he could applywith any hope of borrowing."Man's extremity is the devil's opportunity." It was so in thepresent case, Green had a number of collections to make on that day,and his evil counsellors suggested his holding back the return oftwo of these, amounting to his indebtedness, and say that theparties were not yet ready to settle their bills. This would enablehim to get rid of Bland, and gain time. So, acting upon the badsuggestion, he made up his return of collections, omitting the twoaccounts to which we have referred.Now it so happened that one of the persons against whom theseaccounts stood, met Mr. Phillips as he was returning from dinner inthe afternoon, and said to him,--"I settled that bill of yours to-day.""That's right. I wish all my customers were as punctual," answeredMr. Phillips."I gave your young man a check for a hundred and five dollars.""Thank you."And the two men passed their respective ways.On Mr. Phillips's return to his store, Martin rendered his accountof collections, and, to the surprise of his employer, omitted theone in regard to which he had just been notified."Is this all?" he asked, in a tone that sent a thrill of alarm tothe guilty heart of his clerk."Yes, sir," was the not clearly outspoken answer."Didn't Garland pay?""N-n-o, sir!" The suddenness of this question so confounded Martin,that he could not answer without a betraying hesitation."Martin!" Astonishment, rebuke, and accusation were in the voice ofMr. Phillips as he pronounced his clerk's name. Martin's faceflushed deeply, and then grew very pale. He stood the image of guiltand fear for some moments, then, drawing out his pocket book, hebrought therefrom a small roll of bank bills, and a memorandum slipof paper."I made these collections also." And he gave the money andmemorandum to Mr. Phillips."A hundred and fifty dollars withheld! Martin! Martin! what doesthis mean?""Heaven is my witness, sir," answered the young man, with quiveringlips, "that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had nointention of wronging you now. But I am in a fearful strait. My feethave become suddenly mired, and this was a desperate struggle forextrication--a temporary expedient only, not a premeditated wrongagainst you.""Sit down, Martin," said Mr. Phillips, in a grave, but not severe,tone of voice. "Let me understand the case from first to last.Conceal nothing, if you wish to have me for a friend."Thus enjoined, Martin told his humiliating story."If you had not gone into the way of temptation, the betrayer hadnot found you," was the remark of Mr. Phillips, when the young manended his confession. "Do you frequent these eating and drinkingsaloons?""I go occasionally, sir.""They are neither safe nor reputable, Martin. A young man whofrequents them must have the fine tone of his manhood dimmed. Thereis an atmosphere of impurity about these places. Have you a youngerbrother?""Yes, sir.""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth tomanhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?""No, sir, I would do all in my power to prevent it.""Why?""There's danger in them, sir.""And, knowing this, you went into the way of danger, and havefallen!"Martin dropped his eyes to the floor in confusion."Bland is a stool-pigeon and you were betrayed.""What am I to do?" asked the troubled young man. "I am in debt tohim.""He will be here to-morrow.""Yes, sir.""I will have a policeman ready to receive him.""O, no, no, Sir. Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself. I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth. One experiencelike this should last you a life-time."Thus Martin escaped from his dangerous entanglement, but never againto hold the unwavering confidence of his employer. Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green. He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S.

Have you a youngerbrother?""Yes, sir.""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth tomanhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?""No, sir, I would do all in my power to prevent it.""Why?""There's danger in them, sir.""And, knowing this, you went into the way of danger, and havefallen!"Martin dropped his eyes to the floor in confusion."Bland is a stool-pigeon and you were betrayed.""What am I to do?" asked the troubled young man. "I am in debt tohim.""He will be here to-morrow.""Yes, sir.""I will have a policeman ready to receive him.""O, no, no, Sir. Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself. I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth. One experiencelike this should last you a life-time."Thus Martin escaped from his dangerous entanglement, but never againto hold the unwavering confidence of his employer. Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green. He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; It's None of My Business "This is cosy," was the approving remark of Bland, as they entered.Hats and overcoats were laid aside, and they drew around a tablethat stood in the centre of the room under the gaslight. A fewpassages were read from Shakspeare, then drink was ordered by one ofthe the party. The reading interspersed with critical comments, wasagain resumed; but the reading soon gave way entire to the comments,which, in a little while, passed from the text of Shakspeare toactors, actresses, prima donnas, and ballet-dancers, the relativemerits of which were knowingly discussed for some time. In the midstof this discussion, oysters, in two or three styles, and a smokingdish of terrapin, ordered by a member of the company--which our youngfriend Green did not know--were brought in, followed by a liberalsupply of wine and brandy. Bland expressed surprise, but acceptedthe entertainment as quite agreeable to himself.After the supper, cigars were introduced, and after the cigars,cards. A few games were played for shilling stakes. Green, under theinfluence of more liquor than his head could bear, and in the midstof companions whose sphere he could not, in consequence, resist,yielded in a new direction for him. Of gambling he had alwaysentertained a virtuous disapproval; yet, ere aware of the directionin which he was drifting, he was staking money at cards, the sumsgradually increasing, until from shillings the ventures increased todollars. Sometimes he won, and sometimes he lost; the winningsstimulating to new trials in the hope of further success, and thelosses stimulating to new trials in order to recover, if possible;but, steadily, the tide, for all these little eddies of success,bore him downwards, and losses increased from single dollars tofives, and from fives to tens, his pleasant friend, Bland, supplyingwhatever he wanted in the most disinterested way, until an aggregateloss of nearly a hundred and fifty dollars sobered and appalled him.The salary of Martin Green was only four hundred dollars, every centof which was expended as fast as earned. A loss of a hundred andfifty dollars was, therefore, a serious and embarrassing matter."I'll call and see you to-morrow, when we can arrange this littlematter," said Mr. Bland, "on parting with Green at his own door. Hespoke pleasantly, but with something in his voice that chilled thenerves of his victim. On the next day while Green stood at his desk,trying to fix his mind upon his work, and do it correctly, hisemployer said,--"Martin, there's a young man in the store who has asked for you."Green turned and saw the last man on the earth he desired to meet.His pleasant friend of the evening before had called to "arrangethat little matter.""Not too soon for you, I hope," remarked Bland, with his courteous,yet now serious, smile, as he took the victim's hand."Yes, you are, too soon," was soberly answered.The smile faded off of Bland's face."When will you arrange it?""In a few days.""But I want the money to-day. It was a simple loan, you know.""I am aware of that, but the amount is larger than I can manage atonce," said Green."Can I have a part to-day?""Not to-day.""To-morrow, then?""I'll do the best in my power.""Very well. To-morrow, at this time, I will call. Make up the wholesum if possible, for I want it badly.""Do you know that young man?" asked Mr. Phillips, the employer ofGreen, as the latter came back to his desk. The face of Mr. Phillipswas unusually serious."His name is Bland.""Why has he called to see you?" The eyes of Mr. Phillips were fixedintently on his clerk."He merely dropped in. I have met him a few times in company.""Don't you know his character?""I never heard a word against him," said Green."Why, Martin!" replied Mr. Phillips, "he has the reputation of beingone of the worst young men in our city; a base gambler'sstool-pigeon, some say.""I am glad to know it, sir," Martin had the presence of mind, in thepainful confusion that overwhelmed him, to say, "and shall treat himaccordingly." He went back to his desk, and resumed his work.It is the easiest thing in the world to go to astray, but alwaysdifficult to return, Martin Green was astray, but how was he to getinto the right path again? A barrier that seemed impassable was nowlying across the way over which he had passed, a little whilebefore, with lightest footsteps. Alone and unaided, he could notsafely get back. The evil spirits that lure a man from virtue nevercounsel aright when to seek to return. They magnify the perils thatbeset the road by which alone is safety, and suggest other ways thatlead into labyrinths of evil from which escape is sometimesimpossible. These spirits were now at the ear of our unhappy youngfriend, suggesting methods of relief in his embarrassing position.If Bland were indeed such a character as Mr. Phillips hadrepresented him, it would be ruin, in his employer's estimation, tohave him call again and again for his debt. But how was he toliquidate that debt? There was nothing due him on account of salary,and there was not a friend or acquaintance to whom he could applywith any hope of borrowing."Man's extremity is the devil's opportunity." It was so in thepresent case, Green had a number of collections to make on that day,and his evil counsellors suggested his holding back the return oftwo of these, amounting to his indebtedness, and say that theparties were not yet ready to settle their bills. This would enablehim to get rid of Bland, and gain time. So, acting upon the badsuggestion, he made up his return of collections, omitting the twoaccounts to which we have referred.Now it so happened that one of the persons against whom theseaccounts stood, met Mr. Phillips as he was returning from dinner inthe afternoon, and said to him,--"I settled that bill of yours to-day.""That's right. I wish all my customers were as punctual," answeredMr. Phillips."I gave your young man a check for a hundred and five dollars.""Thank you."And the two men passed their respective ways.On Mr. Phillips's return to his store, Martin rendered his accountof collections, and, to the surprise of his employer, omitted theone in regard to which he had just been notified."Is this all?" he asked, in a tone that sent a thrill of alarm tothe guilty heart of his clerk."Yes, sir," was the not clearly outspoken answer."Didn't Garland pay?""N-n-o, sir!" The suddenness of this question so confounded Martin,that he could not answer without a betraying hesitation."Martin!" Astonishment, rebuke, and accusation were in the voice ofMr. Phillips as he pronounced his clerk's name. Martin's faceflushed deeply, and then grew very pale. He stood the image of guiltand fear for some moments, then, drawing out his pocket book, hebrought therefrom a small roll of bank bills, and a memorandum slipof paper."I made these collections also." And he gave the money andmemorandum to Mr. Phillips."A hundred and fifty dollars withheld! Martin! Martin! what doesthis mean?""Heaven is my witness, sir," answered the young man, with quiveringlips, "that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had nointention of wronging you now. But I am in a fearful strait. My feethave become suddenly mired, and this was a desperate struggle forextrication--a temporary expedient only, not a premeditated wrongagainst you.""Sit down, Martin," said Mr. Phillips, in a grave, but not severe,tone of voice. "Let me understand the case from first to last.Conceal nothing, if you wish to have me for a friend."Thus enjoined, Martin told his humiliating story."If you had not gone into the way of temptation, the betrayer hadnot found you," was the remark of Mr. Phillips, when the young manended his confession. "Do you frequent these eating and drinkingsaloons?""I go occasionally, sir.""They are neither safe nor reputable, Martin. A young man whofrequents them must have the fine tone of his manhood dimmed. Thereis an atmosphere of impurity about these places. Have you a youngerbrother?""Yes, sir.""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth tomanhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?""No, sir, I would do all in my power to prevent it.""Why?""There's danger in them, sir.""And, knowing this, you went into the way of danger, and havefallen!"Martin dropped his eyes to the floor in confusion."Bland is a stool-pigeon and you were betrayed.""What am I to do?" asked the troubled young man.

I wish all my customers were as punctual," answeredMr. Phillips."I gave your young man a check for a hundred and five dollars.""Thank you."And the two men passed their respective ways.On Mr. Phillips's return to his store, Martin rendered his accountof collections, and, to the surprise of his employer, omitted theone in regard to which he had just been notified."Is this all?" he asked, in a tone that sent a thrill of alarm tothe guilty heart of his clerk."Yes, sir," was the not clearly outspoken answer."Didn't Garland pay?""N-n-o, sir!" The suddenness of this question so confounded Martin,that he could not answer without a betraying hesitation."Martin!" Astonishment, rebuke, and accusation were in the voice ofMr. Phillips as he pronounced his clerk's name. Martin's faceflushed deeply, and then grew very pale. He stood the image of guiltand fear for some moments, then, drawing out his pocket book, hebrought therefrom a small roll of bank bills, and a memorandum slipof paper."I made these collections also." And he gave the money andmemorandum to Mr. Phillips."A hundred and fifty dollars withheld! Martin! Martin! what doesthis mean?""Heaven is my witness, sir," answered the young man, with quiveringlips, "that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had nointention of wronging you now. But I am in a fearful strait. My feethave become suddenly mired, and this was a desperate struggle forextrication--a temporary expedient only, not a premeditated wrongagainst you.""Sit down, Martin," said Mr. Phillips, in a grave, but not severe,tone of voice. "Let me understand the case from first to last.Conceal nothing, if you wish to have me for a friend."Thus enjoined, Martin told his humiliating story."If you had not gone into the way of temptation, the betrayer hadnot found you," was the remark of Mr. Phillips, when the young manended his confession. "Do you frequent these eating and drinkingsaloons?""I go occasionally, sir.""They are neither safe nor reputable, Martin. A young man whofrequents them must have the fine tone of his manhood dimmed. Thereis an atmosphere of impurity about these places. Have you a youngerbrother?""Yes, sir.""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth tomanhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?""No, sir, I would do all in my power to prevent it.""Why?""There's danger in them, sir.""And, knowing this, you went into the way of danger, and havefallen!"Martin dropped his eyes to the floor in confusion."Bland is a stool-pigeon and you were betrayed.""What am I to do?" asked the troubled young man. "I am in debt tohim.""He will be here to-morrow.""Yes, sir.""I will have a policeman ready to receive him.""O, no, no, Sir. Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself. I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth. One experiencelike this should last you a life-time."Thus Martin escaped from his dangerous entanglement, but never againto hold the unwavering confidence of his employer. Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green. He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; It's None of My Business "I'll call and see you to-morrow, when we can arrange this littlematter," said Mr. Bland, "on parting with Green at his own door. Hespoke pleasantly, but with something in his voice that chilled thenerves of his victim. On the next day while Green stood at his desk,trying to fix his mind upon his work, and do it correctly, hisemployer said,--"Martin, there's a young man in the store who has asked for you."Green turned and saw the last man on the earth he desired to meet.His pleasant friend of the evening before had called to "arrangethat little matter.""Not too soon for you, I hope," remarked Bland, with his courteous,yet now serious, smile, as he took the victim's hand."Yes, you are, too soon," was soberly answered.The smile faded off of Bland's face."When will you arrange it?""In a few days.""But I want the money to-day. It was a simple loan, you know.""I am aware of that, but the amount is larger than I can manage atonce," said Green."Can I have a part to-day?""Not to-day.""To-morrow, then?""I'll do the best in my power.""Very well. To-morrow, at this time, I will call. Make up the wholesum if possible, for I want it badly.""Do you know that young man?" asked Mr. Phillips, the employer ofGreen, as the latter came back to his desk. The face of Mr. Phillipswas unusually serious."His name is Bland.""Why has he called to see you?" The eyes of Mr. Phillips were fixedintently on his clerk."He merely dropped in. I have met him a few times in company.""Don't you know his character?""I never heard a word against him," said Green."Why, Martin!" replied Mr. Phillips, "he has the reputation of beingone of the worst young men in our city; a base gambler'sstool-pigeon, some say.""I am glad to know it, sir," Martin had the presence of mind, in thepainful confusion that overwhelmed him, to say, "and shall treat himaccordingly." He went back to his desk, and resumed his work.It is the easiest thing in the world to go to astray, but alwaysdifficult to return, Martin Green was astray, but how was he to getinto the right path again? A barrier that seemed impassable was nowlying across the way over which he had passed, a little whilebefore, with lightest footsteps. Alone and unaided, he could notsafely get back. The evil spirits that lure a man from virtue nevercounsel aright when to seek to return. They magnify the perils thatbeset the road by which alone is safety, and suggest other ways thatlead into labyrinths of evil from which escape is sometimesimpossible. These spirits were now at the ear of our unhappy youngfriend, suggesting methods of relief in his embarrassing position.If Bland were indeed such a character as Mr. Phillips hadrepresented him, it would be ruin, in his employer's estimation, tohave him call again and again for his debt. But how was he toliquidate that debt? There was nothing due him on account of salary,and there was not a friend or acquaintance to whom he could applywith any hope of borrowing."Man's extremity is the devil's opportunity." It was so in thepresent case, Green had a number of collections to make on that day,and his evil counsellors suggested his holding back the return oftwo of these, amounting to his indebtedness, and say that theparties were not yet ready to settle their bills. This would enablehim to get rid of Bland, and gain time.

"Do you frequent these eating and drinkingsaloons?""I go occasionally, sir.""They are neither safe nor reputable, Martin. A young man whofrequents them must have the fine tone of his manhood dimmed. Thereis an atmosphere of impurity about these places. Have you a youngerbrother?""Yes, sir.""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth tomanhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?""No, sir, I would do all in my power to prevent it.""Why?""There's danger in them, sir.""And, knowing this, you went into the way of danger, and havefallen!"Martin dropped his eyes to the floor in confusion."Bland is a stool-pigeon and you were betrayed.""What am I to do?" asked the troubled young man. "I am in debt tohim.""He will be here to-morrow.""Yes, sir.""I will have a policeman ready to receive him.""O, no, no, Sir. Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself. I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth. One experiencelike this should last you a life-time."Thus Martin escaped from his dangerous entanglement, but never againto hold the unwavering confidence of his employer. Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green. He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; It's None of My Business "Not too soon for you, I hope," remarked Bland, with his courteous,yet now serious, smile, as he took the victim's hand."Yes, you are, too soon," was soberly answered.The smile faded off of Bland's face."When will you arrange it?""In a few days.""But I want the money to-day. It was a simple loan, you know.""I am aware of that, but the amount is larger than I can manage atonce," said Green."Can I have a part to-day?""Not to-day.""To-morrow, then?""I'll do the best in my power.""Very well. To-morrow, at this time, I will call. Make up the wholesum if possible, for I want it badly.""Do you know that young man?" asked Mr. Phillips, the employer ofGreen, as the latter came back to his desk. The face of Mr. Phillipswas unusually serious."His name is Bland.""Why has he called to see you?" The eyes of Mr. Phillips were fixedintently on his clerk."He merely dropped in. I have met him a few times in company.""Don't you know his character?""I never heard a word against him," said Green."Why, Martin!" replied Mr. Phillips, "he has the reputation of beingone of the worst young men in our city; a base gambler'sstool-pigeon, some say.""I am glad to know it, sir," Martin had the presence of mind, in thepainful confusion that overwhelmed him, to say, "and shall treat himaccordingly." He went back to his desk, and resumed his work.It is the easiest thing in the world to go to astray, but alwaysdifficult to return, Martin Green was astray, but how was he to getinto the right path again? A barrier that seemed impassable was nowlying across the way over which he had passed, a little whilebefore, with lightest footsteps. Alone and unaided, he could notsafely get back. The evil spirits that lure a man from virtue nevercounsel aright when to seek to return. They magnify the perils thatbeset the road by which alone is safety, and suggest other ways thatlead into labyrinths of evil from which escape is sometimesimpossible. These spirits were now at the ear of our unhappy youngfriend, suggesting methods of relief in his embarrassing position.If Bland were indeed such a character as Mr. Phillips hadrepresented him, it would be ruin, in his employer's estimation, tohave him call again and again for his debt. But how was he toliquidate that debt? There was nothing due him on account of salary,and there was not a friend or acquaintance to whom he could applywith any hope of borrowing."Man's extremity is the devil's opportunity." It was so in thepresent case, Green had a number of collections to make on that day,and his evil counsellors suggested his holding back the return oftwo of these, amounting to his indebtedness, and say that theparties were not yet ready to settle their bills. This would enablehim to get rid of Bland, and gain time. So, acting upon the badsuggestion, he made up his return of collections, omitting the twoaccounts to which we have referred.Now it so happened that one of the persons against whom theseaccounts stood, met Mr. Phillips as he was returning from dinner inthe afternoon, and said to him,--"I settled that bill of yours to-day.""That's right. I wish all my customers were as punctual," answeredMr. Phillips."I gave your young man a check for a hundred and five dollars.""Thank you."And the two men passed their respective ways.On Mr. Phillips's return to his store, Martin rendered his accountof collections, and, to the surprise of his employer, omitted theone in regard to which he had just been notified."Is this all?" he asked, in a tone that sent a thrill of alarm tothe guilty heart of his clerk."Yes, sir," was the not clearly outspoken answer."Didn't Garland pay?""N-n-o, sir!" The suddenness of this question so confounded Martin,that he could not answer without a betraying hesitation."Martin!" Astonishment, rebuke, and accusation were in the voice ofMr. Phillips as he pronounced his clerk's name. Martin's faceflushed deeply, and then grew very pale. He stood the image of guiltand fear for some moments, then, drawing out his pocket book, hebrought therefrom a small roll of bank bills, and a memorandum slipof paper."I made these collections also." And he gave the money andmemorandum to Mr. Phillips."A hundred and fifty dollars withheld! Martin! Martin! what doesthis mean?""Heaven is my witness, sir," answered the young man, with quiveringlips, "that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had nointention of wronging you now. But I am in a fearful strait. My feethave become suddenly mired, and this was a desperate struggle forextrication--a temporary expedient only, not a premeditated wrongagainst you.""Sit down, Martin," said Mr. Phillips, in a grave, but not severe,tone of voice.

I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth. One experiencelike this should last you a life-time."Thus Martin escaped from his dangerous entanglement, but never againto hold the unwavering confidence of his employer. Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green. He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; It's None of My Business "When will you arrange it?""In a few days.""But I want the money to-day. It was a simple loan, you know.""I am aware of that, but the amount is larger than I can manage atonce," said Green."Can I have a part to-day?""Not to-day.""To-morrow, then?""I'll do the best in my power.""Very well. To-morrow, at this time, I will call. Make up the wholesum if possible, for I want it badly.""Do you know that young man?" asked Mr. Phillips, the employer ofGreen, as the latter came back to his desk. The face of Mr. Phillipswas unusually serious."His name is Bland.""Why has he called to see you?" The eyes of Mr. Phillips were fixedintently on his clerk."He merely dropped in. I have met him a few times in company.""Don't you know his character?""I never heard a word against him," said Green."Why, Martin!" replied Mr. Phillips, "he has the reputation of beingone of the worst young men in our city; a base gambler'sstool-pigeon, some say.""I am glad to know it, sir," Martin had the presence of mind, in thepainful confusion that overwhelmed him, to say, "and shall treat himaccordingly." He went back to his desk, and resumed his work.It is the easiest thing in the world to go to astray, but alwaysdifficult to return, Martin Green was astray, but how was he to getinto the right path again? A barrier that seemed impassable was nowlying across the way over which he had passed, a little whilebefore, with lightest footsteps. Alone and unaided, he could notsafely get back. The evil spirits that lure a man from virtue nevercounsel aright when to seek to return. They magnify the perils thatbeset the road by which alone is safety, and suggest other ways thatlead into labyrinths of evil from which escape is sometimesimpossible. These spirits were now at the ear of our unhappy youngfriend, suggesting methods of relief in his embarrassing position.If Bland were indeed such a character as Mr. Phillips hadrepresented him, it would be ruin, in his employer's estimation, tohave him call again and again for his debt. But how was he toliquidate that debt? There was nothing due him on account of salary,and there was not a friend or acquaintance to whom he could applywith any hope of borrowing."Man's extremity is the devil's opportunity." It was so in thepresent case, Green had a number of collections to make on that day,and his evil counsellors suggested his holding back the return oftwo of these, amounting to his indebtedness, and say that theparties were not yet ready to settle their bills. This would enablehim to get rid of Bland, and gain time. So, acting upon the badsuggestion, he made up his return of collections, omitting the twoaccounts to which we have referred.Now it so happened that one of the persons against whom theseaccounts stood, met Mr. Phillips as he was returning from dinner inthe afternoon, and said to him,--"I settled that bill of yours to-day.""That's right. I wish all my customers were as punctual," answeredMr. Phillips."I gave your young man a check for a hundred and five dollars.""Thank you."And the two men passed their respective ways.On Mr. Phillips's return to his store, Martin rendered his accountof collections, and, to the surprise of his employer, omitted theone in regard to which he had just been notified."Is this all?" he asked, in a tone that sent a thrill of alarm tothe guilty heart of his clerk."Yes, sir," was the not clearly outspoken answer."Didn't Garland pay?""N-n-o, sir!" The suddenness of this question so confounded Martin,that he could not answer without a betraying hesitation."Martin!" Astonishment, rebuke, and accusation were in the voice ofMr. Phillips as he pronounced his clerk's name. Martin's faceflushed deeply, and then grew very pale. He stood the image of guiltand fear for some moments, then, drawing out his pocket book, hebrought therefrom a small roll of bank bills, and a memorandum slipof paper."I made these collections also." And he gave the money andmemorandum to Mr. Phillips."A hundred and fifty dollars withheld! Martin! Martin! what doesthis mean?""Heaven is my witness, sir," answered the young man, with quiveringlips, "that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had nointention of wronging you now. But I am in a fearful strait. My feethave become suddenly mired, and this was a desperate struggle forextrication--a temporary expedient only, not a premeditated wrongagainst you.""Sit down, Martin," said Mr. Phillips, in a grave, but not severe,tone of voice. "Let me understand the case from first to last.Conceal nothing, if you wish to have me for a friend."Thus enjoined, Martin told his humiliating story."If you had not gone into the way of temptation, the betrayer hadnot found you," was the remark of Mr. Phillips, when the young manended his confession. "Do you frequent these eating and drinkingsaloons?""I go occasionally, sir.""They are neither safe nor reputable, Martin. A young man whofrequents them must have the fine tone of his manhood dimmed. Thereis an atmosphere of impurity about these places. Have you a youngerbrother?""Yes, sir.""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth tomanhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?""No, sir, I would do all in my power to prevent it.""Why?""There's danger in them, sir.""And, knowing this, you went into the way of danger, and havefallen!"Martin dropped his eyes to the floor in confusion."Bland is a stool-pigeon and you were betrayed.""What am I to do?" asked the troubled young man. "I am in debt tohim.""He will be here to-morrow.""Yes, sir.""I will have a policeman ready to receive him.""O, no, no, Sir. Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself. I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!"

A barrier that seemed impassable was nowlying across the way over which he had passed, a little whilebefore, with lightest footsteps. Alone and unaided, he could notsafely get back. The evil spirits that lure a man from virtue nevercounsel aright when to seek to return. They magnify the perils thatbeset the road by which alone is safety, and suggest other ways thatlead into labyrinths of evil from which escape is sometimesimpossible. These spirits were now at the ear of our unhappy youngfriend, suggesting methods of relief in his embarrassing position.If Bland were indeed such a character as Mr. Phillips hadrepresented him, it would be ruin, in his employer's estimation, tohave him call again and again for his debt. But how was he toliquidate that debt? There was nothing due him on account of salary,and there was not a friend or acquaintance to whom he could applywith any hope of borrowing."Man's extremity is the devil's opportunity." It was so in thepresent case, Green had a number of collections to make on that day,and his evil counsellors suggested his holding back the return oftwo of these, amounting to his indebtedness, and say that theparties were not yet ready to settle their bills. This would enablehim to get rid of Bland, and gain time. So, acting upon the badsuggestion, he made up his return of collections, omitting the twoaccounts to which we have referred.Now it so happened that one of the persons against whom theseaccounts stood, met Mr. Phillips as he was returning from dinner inthe afternoon, and said to him,--"I settled that bill of yours to-day.""That's right. I wish all my customers were as punctual," answeredMr. Phillips."I gave your young man a check for a hundred and five dollars.""Thank you."And the two men passed their respective ways.On Mr. Phillips's return to his store, Martin rendered his accountof collections, and, to the surprise of his employer, omitted theone in regard to which he had just been notified."Is this all?" he asked, in a tone that sent a thrill of alarm tothe guilty heart of his clerk."Yes, sir," was the not clearly outspoken answer."Didn't Garland pay?""N-n-o, sir!" The suddenness of this question so confounded Martin,that he could not answer without a betraying hesitation."Martin!" Astonishment, rebuke, and accusation were in the voice ofMr. Phillips as he pronounced his clerk's name. Martin's faceflushed deeply, and then grew very pale. He stood the image of guiltand fear for some moments, then, drawing out his pocket book, hebrought therefrom a small roll of bank bills, and a memorandum slipof paper."I made these collections also." And he gave the money andmemorandum to Mr. Phillips."A hundred and fifty dollars withheld! Martin! Martin! what doesthis mean?""Heaven is my witness, sir," answered the young man, with quiveringlips, "that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had nointention of wronging you now. But I am in a fearful strait. My feethave become suddenly mired, and this was a desperate struggle forextrication--a temporary expedient only, not a premeditated wrongagainst you.""Sit down, Martin," said Mr. Phillips, in a grave, but not severe,tone of voice. "Let me understand the case from first to last.Conceal nothing, if you wish to have me for a friend."Thus enjoined, Martin told his humiliating story."If you had not gone into the way of temptation, the betrayer hadnot found you," was the remark of Mr. Phillips, when the young manended his confession. "Do you frequent these eating and drinkingsaloons?""I go occasionally, sir.""They are neither safe nor reputable, Martin. A young man whofrequents them must have the fine tone of his manhood dimmed. Thereis an atmosphere of impurity about these places. Have you a youngerbrother?""Yes, sir.""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth tomanhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?""No, sir, I would do all in my power to prevent it.""Why?""There's danger in them, sir.""And, knowing this, you went into the way of danger, and havefallen!"Martin dropped his eyes to the floor in confusion."Bland is a stool-pigeon and you were betrayed.""What am I to do?" asked the troubled young man. "I am in debt tohim.""He will be here to-morrow.""Yes, sir.""I will have a policeman ready to receive him.""O, no, no, Sir. Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself. I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth. One experiencelike this should last you a life-time."Thus Martin escaped from his dangerous entanglement, but never againto hold the unwavering confidence of his employer. Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green. He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S.

Have you a youngerbrother?""Yes, sir.""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth tomanhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?""No, sir, I would do all in my power to prevent it.""Why?""There's danger in them, sir.""And, knowing this, you went into the way of danger, and havefallen!"Martin dropped his eyes to the floor in confusion."Bland is a stool-pigeon and you were betrayed.""What am I to do?" asked the troubled young man. "I am in debt tohim.""He will be here to-morrow.""Yes, sir.""I will have a policeman ready to receive him.""O, no, no, Sir. Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself. I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth. One experiencelike this should last you a life-time."Thus Martin escaped from his dangerous entanglement, but never againto hold the unwavering confidence of his employer. Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green. He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; It's None of My Business "I'll do the best in my power.""Very well. To-morrow, at this time, I will call. Make up the wholesum if possible, for I want it badly.""Do you know that young man?" asked Mr. Phillips, the employer ofGreen, as the latter came back to his desk. The face of Mr. Phillipswas unusually serious."His name is Bland.""Why has he called to see you?" The eyes of Mr. Phillips were fixedintently on his clerk."He merely dropped in. I have met him a few times in company.""Don't you know his character?""I never heard a word against him," said Green."Why, Martin!" replied Mr. Phillips, "he has the reputation of beingone of the worst young men in our city; a base gambler'sstool-pigeon, some say.""I am glad to know it, sir," Martin had the presence of mind, in thepainful confusion that overwhelmed him, to say, "and shall treat himaccordingly." He went back to his desk, and resumed his work.It is the easiest thing in the world to go to astray, but alwaysdifficult to return, Martin Green was astray, but how was he to getinto the right path again? A barrier that seemed impassable was nowlying across the way over which he had passed, a little whilebefore, with lightest footsteps. Alone and unaided, he could notsafely get back. The evil spirits that lure a man from virtue nevercounsel aright when to seek to return. They magnify the perils thatbeset the road by which alone is safety, and suggest other ways thatlead into labyrinths of evil from which escape is sometimesimpossible. These spirits were now at the ear of our unhappy youngfriend, suggesting methods of relief in his embarrassing position.If Bland were indeed such a character as Mr. Phillips hadrepresented him, it would be ruin, in his employer's estimation, tohave him call again and again for his debt. But how was he toliquidate that debt? There was nothing due him on account of salary,and there was not a friend or acquaintance to whom he could applywith any hope of borrowing."Man's extremity is the devil's opportunity." It was so in thepresent case, Green had a number of collections to make on that day,and his evil counsellors suggested his holding back the return oftwo of these, amounting to his indebtedness, and say that theparties were not yet ready to settle their bills. This would enablehim to get rid of Bland, and gain time. So, acting upon the badsuggestion, he made up his return of collections, omitting the twoaccounts to which we have referred.Now it so happened that one of the persons against whom theseaccounts stood, met Mr. Phillips as he was returning from dinner inthe afternoon, and said to him,--"I settled that bill of yours to-day.""That's right. I wish all my customers were as punctual," answeredMr. Phillips."I gave your young man a check for a hundred and five dollars.""Thank you."And the two men passed their respective ways.On Mr. Phillips's return to his store, Martin rendered his accountof collections, and, to the surprise of his employer, omitted theone in regard to which he had just been notified."Is this all?" he asked, in a tone that sent a thrill of alarm tothe guilty heart of his clerk."Yes, sir," was the not clearly outspoken answer."Didn't Garland pay?""N-n-o, sir!" The suddenness of this question so confounded Martin,that he could not answer without a betraying hesitation."Martin!" Astonishment, rebuke, and accusation were in the voice ofMr. Phillips as he pronounced his clerk's name. Martin's faceflushed deeply, and then grew very pale. He stood the image of guiltand fear for some moments, then, drawing out his pocket book, hebrought therefrom a small roll of bank bills, and a memorandum slipof paper."I made these collections also." And he gave the money andmemorandum to Mr. Phillips."A hundred and fifty dollars withheld! Martin! Martin! what doesthis mean?""Heaven is my witness, sir," answered the young man, with quiveringlips, "that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had nointention of wronging you now. But I am in a fearful strait. My feethave become suddenly mired, and this was a desperate struggle forextrication--a temporary expedient only, not a premeditated wrongagainst you.""Sit down, Martin," said Mr. Phillips, in a grave, but not severe,tone of voice. "Let me understand the case from first to last.Conceal nothing, if you wish to have me for a friend."Thus enjoined, Martin told his humiliating story."If you had not gone into the way of temptation, the betrayer hadnot found you," was the remark of Mr. Phillips, when the young manended his confession. "Do you frequent these eating and drinkingsaloons?""I go occasionally, sir.""They are neither safe nor reputable, Martin. A young man whofrequents them must have the fine tone of his manhood dimmed.

He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; It's None of My Business "His name is Bland.""Why has he called to see you?" The eyes of Mr. Phillips were fixedintently on his clerk."He merely dropped in. I have met him a few times in company.""Don't you know his character?""I never heard a word against him," said Green."Why, Martin!" replied Mr. Phillips, "he has the reputation of beingone of the worst young men in our city; a base gambler'sstool-pigeon, some say.""I am glad to know it, sir," Martin had the presence of mind, in thepainful confusion that overwhelmed him, to say, "and shall treat himaccordingly." He went back to his desk, and resumed his work.It is the easiest thing in the world to go to astray, but alwaysdifficult to return, Martin Green was astray, but how was he to getinto the right path again? A barrier that seemed impassable was nowlying across the way over which he had passed, a little whilebefore, with lightest footsteps. Alone and unaided, he could notsafely get back. The evil spirits that lure a man from virtue nevercounsel aright when to seek to return. They magnify the perils thatbeset the road by which alone is safety, and suggest other ways thatlead into labyrinths of evil from which escape is sometimesimpossible. These spirits were now at the ear of our unhappy youngfriend, suggesting methods of relief in his embarrassing position.If Bland were indeed such a character as Mr. Phillips hadrepresented him, it would be ruin, in his employer's estimation, tohave him call again and again for his debt. But how was he toliquidate that debt? There was nothing due him on account of salary,and there was not a friend or acquaintance to whom he could applywith any hope of borrowing."Man's extremity is the devil's opportunity." It was so in thepresent case, Green had a number of collections to make on that day,and his evil counsellors suggested his holding back the return oftwo of these, amounting to his indebtedness, and say that theparties were not yet ready to settle their bills. This would enablehim to get rid of Bland, and gain time. So, acting upon the badsuggestion, he made up his return of collections, omitting the twoaccounts to which we have referred.Now it so happened that one of the persons against whom theseaccounts stood, met Mr. Phillips as he was returning from dinner inthe afternoon, and said to him,--"I settled that bill of yours to-day.""That's right. I wish all my customers were as punctual," answeredMr. Phillips."I gave your young man a check for a hundred and five dollars.""Thank you."And the two men passed their respective ways.On Mr. Phillips's return to his store, Martin rendered his accountof collections, and, to the surprise of his employer, omitted theone in regard to which he had just been notified."Is this all?" he asked, in a tone that sent a thrill of alarm tothe guilty heart of his clerk."Yes, sir," was the not clearly outspoken answer."Didn't Garland pay?""N-n-o, sir!" The suddenness of this question so confounded Martin,that he could not answer without a betraying hesitation."Martin!" Astonishment, rebuke, and accusation were in the voice ofMr. Phillips as he pronounced his clerk's name. Martin's faceflushed deeply, and then grew very pale. He stood the image of guiltand fear for some moments, then, drawing out his pocket book, hebrought therefrom a small roll of bank bills, and a memorandum slipof paper."I made these collections also." And he gave the money andmemorandum to Mr. Phillips."A hundred and fifty dollars withheld! Martin! Martin! what doesthis mean?""Heaven is my witness, sir," answered the young man, with quiveringlips, "that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had nointention of wronging you now. But I am in a fearful strait. My feethave become suddenly mired, and this was a desperate struggle forextrication--a temporary expedient only, not a premeditated wrongagainst you.""Sit down, Martin," said Mr. Phillips, in a grave, but not severe,tone of voice. "Let me understand the case from first to last.Conceal nothing, if you wish to have me for a friend."Thus enjoined, Martin told his humiliating story."If you had not gone into the way of temptation, the betrayer hadnot found you," was the remark of Mr. Phillips, when the young manended his confession. "Do you frequent these eating and drinkingsaloons?""I go occasionally, sir.""They are neither safe nor reputable, Martin. A young man whofrequents them must have the fine tone of his manhood dimmed. Thereis an atmosphere of impurity about these places. Have you a youngerbrother?""Yes, sir.""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth tomanhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?""No, sir, I would do all in my power to prevent it.""Why?""There's danger in them, sir.""And, knowing this, you went into the way of danger, and havefallen!"Martin dropped his eyes to the floor in confusion."Bland is a stool-pigeon and you were betrayed.""What am I to do?" asked the troubled young man. "I am in debt tohim.""He will be here to-morrow.""Yes, sir.""I will have a policeman ready to receive him.""O, no, no, Sir. Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself. I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth. One experiencelike this should last you a life-time."Thus Martin escaped from his dangerous entanglement, but never againto hold the unwavering confidence of his employer. Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench.

Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself. I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth.

Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green.

I wish all my customers were as punctual," answeredMr. Phillips."I gave your young man a check for a hundred and five dollars.""Thank you."And the two men passed their respective ways.On Mr. Phillips's return to his store, Martin rendered his accountof collections, and, to the surprise of his employer, omitted theone in regard to which he had just been notified."Is this all?" he asked, in a tone that sent a thrill of alarm tothe guilty heart of his clerk."Yes, sir," was the not clearly outspoken answer."Didn't Garland pay?""N-n-o, sir!" The suddenness of this question so confounded Martin,that he could not answer without a betraying hesitation."Martin!" Astonishment, rebuke, and accusation were in the voice ofMr. Phillips as he pronounced his clerk's name. Martin's faceflushed deeply, and then grew very pale. He stood the image of guiltand fear for some moments, then, drawing out his pocket book, hebrought therefrom a small roll of bank bills, and a memorandum slipof paper."I made these collections also." And he gave the money andmemorandum to Mr. Phillips."A hundred and fifty dollars withheld! Martin! Martin! what doesthis mean?""Heaven is my witness, sir," answered the young man, with quiveringlips, "that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had nointention of wronging you now. But I am in a fearful strait. My feethave become suddenly mired, and this was a desperate struggle forextrication--a temporary expedient only, not a premeditated wrongagainst you.""Sit down, Martin," said Mr. Phillips, in a grave, but not severe,tone of voice. "Let me understand the case from first to last.Conceal nothing, if you wish to have me for a friend."Thus enjoined, Martin told his humiliating story."If you had not gone into the way of temptation, the betrayer hadnot found you," was the remark of Mr. Phillips, when the young manended his confession. "Do you frequent these eating and drinkingsaloons?""I go occasionally, sir.""They are neither safe nor reputable, Martin. A young man whofrequents them must have the fine tone of his manhood dimmed. Thereis an atmosphere of impurity about these places. Have you a youngerbrother?""Yes, sir.""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth tomanhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?""No, sir, I would do all in my power to prevent it.""Why?""There's danger in them, sir.""And, knowing this, you went into the way of danger, and havefallen!"Martin dropped his eyes to the floor in confusion."Bland is a stool-pigeon and you were betrayed.""What am I to do?" asked the troubled young man. "I am in debt tohim.""He will be here to-morrow.""Yes, sir.""I will have a policeman ready to receive him.""O, no, no, Sir. Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself. I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth. One experiencelike this should last you a life-time."Thus Martin escaped from his dangerous entanglement, but never againto hold the unwavering confidence of his employer. Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green. He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; It's None of My Business If Bland were indeed such a character as Mr. Phillips hadrepresented him, it would be ruin, in his employer's estimation, tohave him call again and again for his debt. But how was he toliquidate that debt? There was nothing due him on account of salary,and there was not a friend or acquaintance to whom he could applywith any hope of borrowing."Man's extremity is the devil's opportunity." It was so in thepresent case, Green had a number of collections to make on that day,and his evil counsellors suggested his holding back the return oftwo of these, amounting to his indebtedness, and say that theparties were not yet ready to settle their bills. This would enablehim to get rid of Bland, and gain time.

Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth. One experiencelike this should last you a life-time."Thus Martin escaped from his dangerous entanglement, but never againto hold the unwavering confidence of his employer. Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green. He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S.

I wish all my customers were as punctual," answeredMr. Phillips."I gave your young man a check for a hundred and five dollars.""Thank you."And the two men passed their respective ways.On Mr. Phillips's return to his store, Martin rendered his accountof collections, and, to the surprise of his employer, omitted theone in regard to which he had just been notified."Is this all?" he asked, in a tone that sent a thrill of alarm tothe guilty heart of his clerk."Yes, sir," was the not clearly outspoken answer."Didn't Garland pay?""N-n-o, sir!" The suddenness of this question so confounded Martin,that he could not answer without a betraying hesitation."Martin!" Astonishment, rebuke, and accusation were in the voice ofMr. Phillips as he pronounced his clerk's name. Martin's faceflushed deeply, and then grew very pale. He stood the image of guiltand fear for some moments, then, drawing out his pocket book, hebrought therefrom a small roll of bank bills, and a memorandum slipof paper."I made these collections also." And he gave the money andmemorandum to Mr. Phillips."A hundred and fifty dollars withheld! Martin! Martin! what doesthis mean?""Heaven is my witness, sir," answered the young man, with quiveringlips, "that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had nointention of wronging you now. But I am in a fearful strait.

"Let me understand the case from first to last.Conceal nothing, if you wish to have me for a friend."Thus enjoined, Martin told his humiliating story."If you had not gone into the way of temptation, the betrayer hadnot found you," was the remark of Mr. Phillips, when the young manended his confession. "Do you frequent these eating and drinkingsaloons?""I go occasionally, sir.""They are neither safe nor reputable, Martin. A young man whofrequents them must have the fine tone of his manhood dimmed. Thereis an atmosphere of impurity about these places. Have you a youngerbrother?""Yes, sir.""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth tomanhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?""No, sir, I would do all in my power to prevent it.""Why?""There's danger in them, sir.""And, knowing this, you went into the way of danger, and havefallen!"Martin dropped his eyes to the floor in confusion."Bland is a stool-pigeon and you were betrayed.""What am I to do?" asked the troubled young man. "I am in debt tohim.""He will be here to-morrow.""Yes, sir.""I will have a policeman ready to receive him.""O, no, no, Sir. Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself.

"I am in debt tohim.""He will be here to-morrow.""Yes, sir.""I will have a policeman ready to receive him.""O, no, no, Sir. Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself.

Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth.

Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green. He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S.

Astonishment, rebuke, and accusation were in the voice ofMr. Phillips as he pronounced his clerk's name. Martin's faceflushed deeply, and then grew very pale.

Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself. I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth. One experiencelike this should last you a life-time."Thus Martin escaped from his dangerous entanglement, but never againto hold the unwavering confidence of his employer. Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green. He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S.

Read the next short story; It's None of My Business "If you had not gone into the way of temptation, the betrayer hadnot found you," was the remark of Mr. Phillips, when the young manended his confession. "Do you frequent these eating and drinkingsaloons?""I go occasionally, sir.""They are neither safe nor reputable, Martin. A young man whofrequents them must have the fine tone of his manhood dimmed. Thereis an atmosphere of impurity about these places. Have you a youngerbrother?""Yes, sir.""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth tomanhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?""No, sir, I would do all in my power to prevent it.""Why?""There's danger in them, sir.""And, knowing this, you went into the way of danger, and havefallen!"Martin dropped his eyes to the floor in confusion."Bland is a stool-pigeon and you were betrayed.""What am I to do?" asked the troubled young man. "I am in debt tohim.""He will be here to-morrow.""Yes, sir.""I will have a policeman ready to receive him.""O, no, no, Sir. Pray don't do that!" answered Martin, with adistressed look."Why not?" demanded Mr. Phillips."It will ruin me.""How?""Bland will denounce me.""Let him.""I shall be exposed to the policeman.""An evil, but a mild one, compared with that to which you wererushing in order to disentangle yourself. I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you. I know him and his prowling gang, and theyare a set of as hardened and dangerous villains as can be found inthe city. You are 'spotted' by them from this day, and they number adozen at least. So, if you would be safe, avoid their haunts. Givedrinking saloons and billiard rooms a wide berth. One experiencelike this should last you a life-time."Thus Martin escaped from his dangerous entanglement, but never againto hold the unwavering confidence of his employer. Mr. Phillipspitied, but could not trust him fully. A year afterwards cametroublesome times, losses in business, and depression in trade.Every man had to retrench. Thousands of clerks lost their places,and anxiety and distress were on every hand. Mr. Phillips, likeothers, had to reduce expenses, and, in reducing, the lot to go fellupon Martin Green.

Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you.

The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you.

I must have my way, sir.This matter has assumed a serious aspect. You are in my power, andmust submit."On the next day, punctual to the hour, Bland called."This is your man," said Mr. Phillips to his clerk. "Ask him intothe counting-room." Bland, thus invited, walked back. As he entered,Mr. Phillips said,--"My clerk owes you a hundred and fifty dollars, I understand.""Yes, sir;" and the villain bowed."Make him out a receipt," said Mr. Phillips."When I receive the money," was coldly and resolutely answered.Martin glanced sideways at the face of Bland, and the sudden changein its expression chilled him. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspecthe could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiendthan a man. In pictures he had seen eyes such as now gleamed on Mr.Phillips, but never in a living face before.The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, nowgave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside, and, comingforward, stood beside Mr. Phillips, and looked steadily at the faceof Bland, over which passed another change: it was less assured, butnot less malignant.Mr. Phillips took out his pocket-book, and, laying a twenty-dollarbill on the desk by which they were standing, said,--"Take this and sign a receipt.""No, sir!" was given with determined emphasis. "I am not to berobbed in this way!""Ned," the officer now spoke, "take my advice, and sign a receipt.""It's a cursed swindle!" exclaimed the baffled villain."We will dispense with hard names, sir!" The officer addressed himsternly. "Either take the money, or go. This is not a meeting forparley. I understand you and your operations."A few moments Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutchingdesperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching forthe money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back, saying,--"Wait a moment, until I examine the receipt." He read it over, andthen, pushing it towards Bland, said,--"Write 'In full of all demands.'" A growl was the oral response.Bland took the pen again, and wrote as directed."Take my advice, young man, and adopt a safer and more honorablebusiness," said Mr. Phillips, as he gave him the twenty-dollar bill."Keep your advice for them that ask it!" was flung back in his face.A look of hate and revenge burned in the fellow's eyes. Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you.

Afterglaring at Mr. Phillips and Martin in a threatening way for severalmoments, he left more hurriedly than he had entered."And take my advice," said the officer, laying his hand on Martin'sarm,--he spoke in a warning tone,--"and keep out of that man's way.He'll never forgive you.

He had been very circumspect, had kept away fromthe old places where danger lurked, had devoted himself with renewedassiduity to his employer's interests; but, for all this, doubtswere forever arising in the mind of Mr. Phillips, and when thequestion, "Who shall go?" came up, the decision was against Martin.We pity him, but cannot blame his employer.10 Add  In the Way of Temptation to your library.Return to the T.S.
