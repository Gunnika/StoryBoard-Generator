A Serpent had succeeded in surprising an Eagle and had wrappedhimself around the Eagle's neck. The Eagle could not reach theSerpent, neither with beak nor claws. Far into the sky he soaredtrying to shake off his enemy. But the Serpent's hold onlytightened, and slowly the Eagle sank back to earth, gasping forbreath. A Countryman chanced to see the unequal combat. In pity for thenoble Eagle he rushed up and soon had loosened the coilingSerpent and freed the Eagle. The Serpent was furious. He had no chance to bite the watchfulCountryman. Instead he struck at the drinking horn, hanging atthe Countryman's belt, and into it let fly the poison of hisfangs. The Countryman now went on toward home. Becoming thirsty on theway, he filled his horn at a spring, and was about to drink.There was a sudden rush of great wings. Sweeping down, the Eagleseized the poisoned horn from out his savior's hands, and flewaway with it to hide it where it could never be found. An act of kindness is well repaid. 8.7 Add  The Serpent And The Eagle to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
