A Boy was given permission to put his hand into a pitcher to getsome filberts. But he took such a great fistful that he could notdraw his hand out again. There he stood, unwilling to give up asingle filbert and yet unable to get them all out at once. Vexedand disappointed he began to cry. "My boy," said his mother, "be satisfied with half the nuts youhave taken and you will easily get your hand out. Then perhapsyou may have some more filberts some other time." Do not attempt too much at once. 8.6 Add  The Boy And The Filberts to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
