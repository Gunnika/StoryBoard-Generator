At a great meeting of the Animals, who had gathered to elect anew ruler, the Monkey was asked to dance. This he did so well,with a thousand funny capers and grimaces, that the Animals werecarried entirely off their feet with enthusiasm, and then andthere, elected him their king. The Fox did not vote for the Monkey and was much disgusted withthe Animals for electing so unworthy a ruler. One day he found a trap with a bit of meat in it. Hurrying toKing Monkey, he told him he had found a rich treasure, which hehad not touched because it belonged by right to his majesty theMonkey. The greedy Monkey followed the Fox to the trap. As soon as he sawthe meat he grasped eagerly for it, only to find himself heldfast in the trap. The Fox stood off and laughed. "You pretend to be our king," he said, "and cannot even take careof yourself!" Shortly after that, another election among the Animals was held. The true leader proves himself by his qualities. 8.3 Add  The Fox And The Monkey to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
