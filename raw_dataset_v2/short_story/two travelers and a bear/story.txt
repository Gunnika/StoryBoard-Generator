Two Men were traveling in company through a forest, when, all atonce, a huge Bear crashed out of the brush near them. One of the Men, thinking of his own safety, climbed a tree. The other, unable to fight the savage beast alone, threw himselfon the ground and lay still, as if he were dead. He had heardthat a Bear will not touch a dead body. It must have been true, for the Bear snuffed at the Man's headawhile, and then, seeming to be satisfied that he was dead,walked away. The Man in the tree climbed down. "It looked just as if that Bear whispered in your ear," he said."What did he tell you?" "He said," answered the other, "that it was not at all wise tokeep company with a fellow who would desert his friend in amoment of danger." Misfortune is the test of true friendship. 8.7 Add  Two Travelers And A Bear to your library.Return to the Aesop libraryOr read more short stories for kids in our Children's Library  Add  Two Travelers And A Bear to your library.Return to the Aesop libraryOr read more short stories for kids in our Children's Library Return to the Aesop libraryOr read more short stories for kids in our Children's Library Return to the Aesop libraryOr read more short stories for kids in our Children's Library Or read more short stories for kids in our Children's Library
