An Ass found a Lion's skin left in the forest by a hunter. Hedressed himself in it, and amused himself by hiding in a thicketand rushing out suddenly at the animals who passed that way. Alltook to their heels the moment they saw him. The Ass was so pleased to see the animals running away from him,just as if he were King Lion himself, that he could not keep fromexpressing his delight by a loud, harsh bray. A Fox, who ran withthe rest, stopped short as soon as he heard the voice.Approaching the Ass, he said with a laugh: "If you had kept your mouth shut you might have frightened me,too. But you gave yourself away with that silly bray." A fool may deceive by his dress and appearance, but his wordswill soon show what he really is. 9.1 Add  The Ass In The Lions Skin to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
