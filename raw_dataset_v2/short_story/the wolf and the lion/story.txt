A Wolf had stolen a Lamb and was carrying it off to his lair toeat it. But his plans were very much changed when he met a Lion,who, without making any excuses, took the Lamb away from him. The Wolf made off to a safe distance, and then said in a muchinjured tone: "You have no right to take my property like that!" The Lion looked back, but as the Wolf was too far away to betaught a lesson without too much inconvenience, he said: "Your property? Did you buy it, or did the Shepherd make you agift of it? Pray tell me, how did you get it?" What is evil won is evil lost. 8.3 Add  The Wolf And The Lion to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
