A Farmer was driving his wagon along a miry country road after aheavy rain. The horses could hardly drag the load through thedeep mud, and at last came to a standstill when one of the wheelssank to the hub in a rut. The farmer climbed down from his seat and stood beside the wagonlooking at it but without making the least effort to get it outof the rut. All he did was to curse his bad luck and call loudlyon Hercules to come to his aid. Then, it is said, Hercules reallydid appear, saying: "Put your shoulder to the wheel, man, and urge on your horses. Doyou think you can move the wagon by simply looking at it andwhining about it? Hercules will not help unless you make someeffort to help yourself." And when the farmer put his shoulder to the wheel and urged onthe horses, the wagon moved very readily, and soon the Farmer wasriding along in great content and with a good lesson learned. Self help is the best help. Heaven helps those who help themselves. 9.0 Add  Hercules And The Wagoner to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
