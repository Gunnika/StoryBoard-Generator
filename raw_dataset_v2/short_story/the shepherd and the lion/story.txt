A Shepherd, counting his Sheep one day, discovered that a numberof them were missing. Much irritated, he very loudly and boastfully declared that hewould catch the thief and punish him as he deserved. The Shepherdsuspected a Wolf of the deed and so set out toward a rocky regionamong the hills, where there were caves infested by Wolves. Butbefore starting out he made a vow to Jupiter that if he wouldhelp him find the thief he would offer a fat Calf as a sacrifice. The Shepherd searched a long time without finding any Wolves, butjust as he was passing near a large cave on the mountain side, ahuge Lion stalked out, carrying a Sheep. In great terror theShepherd fell on his knees. "Alas, O Jupiter, man does not know what he asks! To find thethief I offered to sacrifice a fat Calf. Now I promise you afull-grown Bull, if you but make the thief go away!" We are often not so eager for what we seek, after we have foundit. Do not foolishly ask for things that would bring ruin if theywere granted. 7.6 Add  The Shepherd And The Lion to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
