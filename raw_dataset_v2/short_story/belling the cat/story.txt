The Mice once called a meeting to decide on a plan to freethemselves of their enemy, the Cat. At least they wished to findsome way of knowing when she was coming, so they might have timeto run away. Indeed, something had to be done, for they lived insuch constant fear of her claws that they hardly dared stir fromtheir dens by night or day. Many plans were discussed, but none of them was thought goodenough. At last a very young Mouse got up and said: "I have a plan that seems very simple, but I know it will besuccessful. All we have to do is to hang a bell about the Cat'sneck. When we hear the bell ringing we will know immediately thatour enemy is coming." All the Mice were much surprised that they had not thought ofsuch a plan before. But in the midst of the rejoicing over theirgood fortune, an old Mouse arose and said: "I will say that the plan of the young Mouse is very good. Butlet me ask one question: Who will bell the Cat?" It is one thing to say that something should be done, but quitea different matter to do it 8.2 Add  Belling The Cat to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
