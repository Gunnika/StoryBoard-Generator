A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging froma vine trained along the branches of a tree.

The grapes seemedready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as hegazed longingly at them.

The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump forit.

The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way.

So hewalked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, onlyto fall short once more.

Again and again he tried, but in vain.

Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.

"What a fool I am," he said.

"Here I am wearing myself out to geta bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for.

" And off he walked very, very scornfully.

There are many who pretend to despise and belittle that which isbeyond their reach.
