A Wolf had been prowling around a flock of Sheep for a long time,and the Shepherd watched very anxiously to prevent him fromcarrying off a Lamb.

But the Wolf did not try to do any harm.

Instead he seemed to be helping the Shepherd take care of theSheep.

At last the Shepherd got so used to seeing the Wolf aboutthat he forgot how wicked he could be.

One day he even went so far as to leave his flock in the Wolf'scare while he went on an errand.

But when he came back and sawhow many of the flock had been killed and carried off, he knewhow foolish to trust a Wolf.

Once a wolf, always a wolf.
