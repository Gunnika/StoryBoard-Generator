A young Mouse in search of adventure was running along the bankof a pond where lived a Frog.

When the Frog saw the Mouse, heswam to the bank and croaked: "Won't you pay me a visit? I can promise you a good time if youdo.

" The Mouse did not need much coaxing, for he was very anxious tosee the world and everything in it.

But though he could swim alittle, he did not dare risk going into the pond without somehelp.

The Frog had a plan.

He tied the Mouse's leg to his own with atough reed.

Then into the pond he jumped, dragging his foolishcompanion with him.

The Mouse soon had enough of it and wanted to return to shore;but the treacherous Frog had other plans.

He pulled the Mousedown under the water and drowned him.

But before he could untiethe reed that bound him to the dead Mouse, a Hawk came sailingover the pond.

Seeing the body of the Mouse floating on thewater, the Hawk swooped down, seized the Mouse and carried itoff, with the Frog dangling from its leg.

Thus at one swoop hehad caught both meat and fish for his dinner.

Those who seek to harm others often come to harm themselvesthrough their own deceit.
