The Tortoise, you know, carries his house on his back.

No matterhow hard he tries, he cannot leave home.

They say that Jupiterpunished him so, because he was such a lazy stay-at-home that hewould not go to Jupiter's wedding, even when especially invited.

After many years, Tortoise began to wish he had gone to thatwedding.

When he saw how gaily the birds flew about and how theHare and the Chipmunk and all the other animals ran nimbly by,always eager to see everything there was to be seen, the Tortoisefelt very sad and discontented.

He wanted to see the world too,and there he was with a house on his back and little short legsthat could hardly drag him along.

One day he met a pair of Ducks and told them all his trouble.

"We can help you to see the world," said the Ducks.

"Take hold ofthis stick with your teeth and we will carry you far up in theair where you can see the whole countryside.

But keep quiet oryou will be sorry.

" The Tortoise was very glad indeed.

He seized the stick firmlywith his teeth, the two Ducks took hold of it one at each end,and away they sailed up toward the clouds.

Just then a Crow flew by.

He was very much astonished at thestrange sight and cried: "This must surely be the King of Tortoises!" "Why certainly——" began the Tortoise.

But as he opened his mouth to say these foolish words he lost hishold on the stick, and down he fell to the ground, where he wasdashed to pieces on a rock.

Foolish curiosity and vanity often lead to misfortune 7.
