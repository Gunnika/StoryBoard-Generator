A certain Wolf could not get enough to eat because of thewatchfulness of the Shepherds.

But one night he found a sheepskin that had been cast aside and forgotten.

The next day,dressed in the skin, the Wolf strolled into the pasture with theSheep.

Soon a little Lamb was following him about and was quicklyled away to slaughter.

That evening the Wolf entered the fold with the flock.

But ithappened that the Shepherd took a fancy for mutton broth thatvery evening, and, picking up a knife, went to the fold.

Therethe first he laid hands on and killed was the Wolf.

The evil doer often comes to harm through his own deceit.
