A Farmer walked through his field one cold winter morning.

On theground lay a Snake, stiff and frozen with the cold.

The Farmerknew how deadly the Snake could be, and yet he picked it up andput it in his bosom to warm it back to life.

The Snake soon revived, and when it had enough strength, bit theman who had been so kind to it.

The bite was deadly and theFarmer felt that he must die.

As he drew his last breath, he saidto those standing around: Learn from my fate not to take pity on a scoundrel.
