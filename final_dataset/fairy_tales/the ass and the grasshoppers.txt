One day as an Ass was walking in the pasture, he found someGrasshoppers chirping merrily in a grassy corner of the field.

He listened with a great deal of admiration to the song of theGrasshoppers.

It was such a joyful song that his pleasure-lovingheart was filled with a wish to sing as they did.

"What is it?" he asked very respectfully, "that has given yousuch beautiful voices? Is there any special food you eat, or isit some divine nectar that makes you sing so wonderfully?" "Yes," said the Grasshoppers, who were very fond of a joke; "itis the dew we drink! Try some and see.

" So thereafter the Ass would eat nothing and drink nothing butdew.

Naturally, the poor foolish Ass soon died.

The laws of nature are unchangeable.
