A Stag had fallen sick.

He had just strength enough to gathersome food and find a quiet clearing in the woods, where he laydown to wait until his strength should return.

The Animals heardabout the Stag's illness and came to ask after his health.

Ofcourse, they were all hungry, and helped themselves freely to theStag's food; and as you would expect, the Stag soon starved todeath.

Good will is worth nothing unless it is accompanied by goodacts.
