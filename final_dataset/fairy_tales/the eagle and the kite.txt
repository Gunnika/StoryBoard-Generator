An Eagle sat high in the branches of a great Oak.

She seemed verysad and drooping for an Eagle.

A Kite saw her.

"Why do you look so woebegone?" asked the Kite.

"I want to get married," replied the Eagle, "and I can't find amate who can provide for me as I should like.

" "Take me," said the Kite; "I am very strong, stronger even thanyou!" "Do you really think you can provide for me?" asked the Eagleeagerly.

"Why, of course," replied the Kite.

"That would be a very simplematter.

I am so strong I can carry away an Ostrich in my talonsas if it were a feather!" The Eagle accepted the Kite immediately.

But after the wedding,when the Kite flew away to find something to eat for his bride,all he had when he returned, was a tiny Mouse.

"Is that the Ostrich you talked about?" said the Eagle indisgust.

"To win you I would have said and promised anything," replied theKite.

Everything is fair in love.
