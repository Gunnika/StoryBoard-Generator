One bright evening as the sun was sinking on a glorious world awise old Cock flew into a tree to roost.

Before he composedhimself to rest, he flapped his wings three times and crowedloudly.

But just as he was about to put his head under his wing,his beady eyes caught a flash of red and a glimpse of a longpointed nose, and there just below him stood Master Fox.

"Have you heard the wonderful news?" cried the Fox in a veryjoyful and excited manner.

"What news?" asked the Cock very calmly.

But he had a queer,fluttery feeling inside him, for, you know, he was very muchafraid of the Fox.

"Your family and mine and all other animals have agreed toforget their differences and live in peace and friendship fromnow on forever.

Just think of it! I simply cannot wait to embraceyou! Do come down, dear friend, and let us celebrate the joyfulevent.

" "How grand!" said the Cock.

"I certainly am delighted at thenews.

" But he spoke in an absent way, and stretching up ontiptoes, seemed to be looking at something afar off.

"What is it you see?" asked the Fox a little anxiously.

"Why, it looks to me like a couple of Dogs coming this way.

Theymust have heard the good news andâ€”" But the Fox did not wait to hear more.

Off he started on a run.

"Wait," cried the Cock.

"Why do you run? The Dogs are friends ofyours now!" "Yes," answered the Fox.

"But they might not have heard the news.

Besides, I have a very important errand that I had almostforgotten about.

" The Cock smiled as he buried his head in his feathers and went tosleep, for he had succeeded in outwitting a very crafty enemy.

The trickster is easily tricked.
