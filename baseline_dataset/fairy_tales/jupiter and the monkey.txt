There was once a baby show among the Animals in the forest.

Jupiter provided the prize.

Of course all the proud mammas fromfar and near brought their babies.

But none got there earlierthan Mother Monkey.

Proudly she presented her baby among theother contestants.

As you can imagine, there was quite a laugh when the Animals sawthe ugly flat-nosed, hairless, pop-eyed little creature.

"Laugh if you will," said the Mother Monkey.

"Though Jupiter maynot give him the prize, I know that he is the prettiest, thesweetest, the dearest darling in the world.

" Mother love is blind.
