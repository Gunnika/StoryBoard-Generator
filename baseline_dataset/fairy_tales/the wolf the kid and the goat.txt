Mother Goat was going to market one morning to get provisions forher household, which consisted of but one little Kid and herself.

"Take good care of the house, my son," she said to the Kid, asshe carefully latched the door.

"Do not let anyone in, unless hegives you this password: 'Down with the Wolf and all his race!'" Strangely enough, a Wolf was lurking near and heard what the Goathad said.

So, as soon as Mother Goat was out of sight, up hetrotted to the door and knocked.

"Down with the Wolf and all his race," said the Wolf softly.

It was the right password, but when the Kid peeped through acrack in the door and saw the shadowy figure outside, he did notfeel at all easy.

"Show me a white paw," he said, "or I won't let you in.

" A white paw, of course, is a feature few Wolves can show, and soMaster Wolf had to go away as hungry as he had come.

"You can never be too sure," said the Kid, when he saw the Wolfmaking off to the woods.

Two sureties are better than one.
