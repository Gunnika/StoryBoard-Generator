Some Boys were playing one day at the edge of a pond in whichlived a family of Frogs.

The Boys amused themselves by throwingstones into the pond so as to make them skip on top of the water.

The stones were flying thick and fast and the Boys were enjoyingthemselves very much; but the poor Frogs in the pond weretrembling with fear.

At last one of the Frogs, the oldest and bravest, put his headout of the water, and said, "Oh, please, dear children, stop yourcruel play! Though it may be fun for you, it means death to us!" Always stop to think whether your fun may not be the cause ofanother's unhappiness.
