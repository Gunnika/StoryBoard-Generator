A long time ago, the Lion, the Fox, the Jackal, and the Wolfagreed to go hunting together, sharing with each other whateverthey found. One day the Wolf ran down a Stag and immediately called hiscomrades to divide the spoil. Without being asked, the Lion placed himself at the head of thefeast to do the carving, and, with a great show of fairness,began to count the guests. "One," he said, counting on his claws, "that is myself the Lion.Two, that's the Wolf, three, is the Jackal, and the Fox makesfour." He then very carefully divided the Stag into four equal parts. "I am King Lion," he said, when he had finished, "so of course Iget the first part. This next part falls to me because I am thestrongest; and this is mine because I am the bravest." He now began to glare at the others very savagely. "If any of youhave any claim to the part that is left," he growled, stretchinghis claws meaningly, "now is the time to speak up." Might makes right. 8.1 Add  The Lion's Share to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
