A Fox and a Leopard, resting lazily after a generous dinner,amused themselves by disputing about their good looks. TheLeopard was very proud of his glossy, spotted coat and madedisdainful remarks about the Fox, whose appearance he declaredwas quite ordinary. The Fox prided himself on his fine bushy tail with its tip ofwhite, but he was wise enough to see that he could not rival theLeopard in looks. Still he kept up a flow of sarcastic talk, justto exercise his wits and to have the fun of disputing. TheLeopard was about to lose his temper when the Fox got up, yawninglazily. "You may have a very smart coat," he said, "but you would be agreat deal better off if you had a little more smartness insideyour head and less on your ribs, the way I am. That's what I callreal beauty." A fine coat is not always an indication of an attractive mind.  9.5 Add  The Fox And The Leopard to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
