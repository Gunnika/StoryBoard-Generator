Once a Cat and a Fox were traveling together. As they went along,picking up provisions on the way—a stray mouse here, a fatchicken there—they began an argument to while away the timebetween bites. And, as usually happens when comrades argue, thetalk began to get personal. "You think you are extremely clever, don't you?" said the Fox."Do you pretend to know more than I? Why, I know a whole sackfulof tricks!" "Well," retorted the Cat, "I admit I know one trick only, butthat one, let me tell you, is worth a thousand of yours!" Just then, close by, they heard a hunter's horn and the yelpingof a pack of hounds. In an instant the Cat was up a tree, hidingamong the leaves. "This is my trick," he called to the Fox. "Now let me see whatyours are worth." But the Fox had so many plans for escape he could not decidewhich one to try first. He dodged here and there with the houndsat his heels. He doubled on his tracks, he ran at top speed, heentered a dozen burrows,—but all in vain. The hounds caught him,and soon put an end to the boaster and all his tricks. Common sense is always worth more than cunning. 8.2 Add  The Cat And The Fox to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
