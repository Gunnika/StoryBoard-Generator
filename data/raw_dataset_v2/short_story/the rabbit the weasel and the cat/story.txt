A Rabbit left his home one day for a dinner of clover. But heforgot to latch the door of his house and while he was gone aWeasel walked in and calmly made himself at home. When the Rabbitreturned, there was the Weasel's nose sticking out of theRabbit's own doorway, sniffing the fine air. The Rabbit was quite angry—for a Rabbit—, and requested theWeasel to move out. But the Weasel was perfectly content. He wassettled down for good. A wise old Cat heard the dispute and offered to settle it. "Come close to me," said the Cat, "I am very deaf. Put yourmouths close to my ears while you tell me the facts." The unsuspecting pair did as they were told and in an instant theCat had them both under her claws. No one could deny that thedispute had been definitely settled. The strong are apt to settle questions to their own advantage. 8.8 Add  The Rabbit The Weasel And The Cat to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
