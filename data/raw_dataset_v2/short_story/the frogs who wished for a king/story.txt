The Frogs were tired of governing themselves. They had so muchfreedom that it had spoiled them, and they did nothing but sitaround croaking in a bored manner and wishing for a governmentthat could entertain them with the pomp and display of royalty,and rule them in a way to make them know they were being ruled.No milk and water government for them, they declared. So theysent a petition to Jupiter asking for a king. Jupiter saw what simple and foolish creatures they were, but tokeep them quiet and make them think they had a king he threw downa huge log, which fell into the water with a great splash. TheFrogs hid themselves among the reeds and grasses, thinking thenew king to be some fearful giant. But they soon discovered howtame and peaceable King Log was. In a short time the youngerFrogs were using him for a diving platform, while the older Frogsmade him a meeting place, where they complained loudly to Jupiterabout the government. To teach the Frogs a lesson the ruler of the gods now sent aCrane to be king of Frogland. The Crane proved to be a verydifferent sort of king from old King Log. He gobbled up the poorFrogs right and left and they soon saw what fools they had been.In mournful croaks they begged Jupiter to take away the crueltyrant before they should all be destroyed. "How now!" cried Jupiter "Are you not yet content? You have whatyou asked for and so you have only yourselves to blame for yourmisfortunes." Be sure you can better your condition before you seek tochange. 8 Add  The Frogs Who Wished For A King to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
