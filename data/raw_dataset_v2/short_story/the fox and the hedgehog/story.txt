A Fox, swimming across a river, was barely able to reach thebank, where he lay bruised and exhausted from his struggle withthe swift current. Soon a swarm of blood-sucking flies settled onhim; but he lay quietly, still too weak to run away from them. A Hedgehog happened by. "Let me drive the flies away," he saidkindly. "No, no!" exclaimed the Fox, "do not disturb them! They havetaken all they can hold. If you drive them away, another greedyswarm will come and take the little blood I have left."
