A certain Father had a family of Sons, who were foreverquarreling among themselves.

No words he could say did the leastgood, so he cast about in his mind for some very striking examplethat should make them see that discord would lead them tomisfortune.

One day when the quarreling had been much more violent than usualand each of the Sons was moping in a surly manner, he asked oneof them to bring him a bundle of sticks.

Then handing the bundleto each of his Sons in turn he told them to try to break it.

Butalthough each one tried his best, none was able to do so.

The Father then untied the bundle and gave the sticks to his Sonsto break one by one.

This they did very easily.

"My Sons," said the Father, "do you not see how certain it isthat if you agree with each other and help each other, it will beimpossible for your enemies to injure you? But if you are dividedamong yourselves, you will be no stronger than a single stick inthat bundle.

" In unity is strength.
