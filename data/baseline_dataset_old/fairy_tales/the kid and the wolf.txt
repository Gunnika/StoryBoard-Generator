A frisky young Kid had been left by the herdsman on the thatchedroof of a sheep shelter to keep him out of harm's way.

The Kidwas browsing near the edge of the roof, when he spied a Wolf andbegan to jeer at him, making faces and abusing him to his heart'scontent.

"I hear you," said the Wolf, "and I haven't the least grudgeagainst you for what you say or do.

When you are up there it isthe roof that's talking, not you.

" Do not say anything at any time that you would not say at alltimes.
