An Ox came down to a reedy pool to drink.

As he splashed heavilyinto the water, he crushed a young Frog into the mud.

The oldFrog soon missed the little one and asked his brothers andsisters what had become of him.

"A great big monster," said one of them, "stepped on littlebrother with one of his huge feet!" "Big, was he!" said the old Frog, puffing herself up.

"Was he asbig as this?" "Oh, much bigger!" they cried.

The Frog puffed up still more.

"He could not have been bigger than this," she said.

But thelittle Frogs all declared that the monster was much, muchbigger and the old Frog kept puffing herself out more and moreuntil, all at once, she burst.

Do not attempt the impossible.
