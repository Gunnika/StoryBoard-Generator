An old Toad once informed all his neighbors that he was a learneddoctor.

In fact he could cure anything.

The Fox heard the newsand hurried to see the Toad.

He looked the Toad over verycarefully.

Toad," he said, "I've been told that you cure anything! Butjust take a look at yourself, and then try some of your ownmedicine.

If you can cure yourself of that blotchy skin and thatrheumatic gait, someone might believe you.

Otherwise, I shouldadvise you to try some other profession.

" Those who would mend others, should first mend themselves.

Physician, heal thyself.
