A lady, handsomely dressed, was about leaving her house to make afew calls, when a little boy ran out from the nursery, and claspingone of her gloved hands in both of his, looked up into her face witha glance of winning entreaty, saying, as he did so:"Mamma! dear mamma! Won't you buy me a picture-book, just likecousin Edie's?" "Yes, love," was the unhesitating reply; and the lady stooped tokiss the sweet lips of her child."Eddy must be a good boy, and mind nurse while mamma is away," sheadded."I'll be so good," replied Eddy, with all the earnestness of achildish purpose. "You may ask nurse when you come home, if I havenot been the goodest little boy that ever was."Mrs. Herbert kissed her darling boy again, and then went forth tomake her morning round of calls. Eddy returned to the nursery,strong in his purpose, to be a good boy, as he had promised."Such a dear little picture-book as mamma is going to bring mehome," he said to nurse, as he leaned his arms against her, andlooked up into her face. "Oh! won't I be so glad. It's to be justlike cousin Edie's. Mamma said so; and cousin Edie's book is sobeautiful. I 've wanted one ever since I was there. Is'nt mammagood?""Yes, Eddy," replied the nurse, "your mamma is very good; and youshould love her so much, and do everything she tells you to do.""I do love her," said the child. "Oh, I love her more than all theworld; and I'm going to mind every thing she says."Then the child went to his play, and was happy with his toys. Buthis thoughts were on the picture-book, and pleasantly his youngimagination lingered amid its attractive pages."Is'nt it 'most time for mother to be home?" he asked, at the end ofhalf an hour, coming to the side of his nurse, and gazing up intoher face."Why no, child," replied the nurse, "not for a long while yet."Eddy looked disappointed. But that instant the door bell rung."There's mamma!" exclaimed the child, clapping his hands; and beforenurse could restrain him, he had bounded from the room, and hislittle feet were heard pattering down the stairs. Slowly he cameback, after a little while, and with a look of disappointment on hissweet young face, entered the nursery, saying, as he did so:"It was only a man with brooms to sell.""Your mamma won't be home for a long time yet, Eddy," said hisnurse, "so it is of no use for you to expect her. Go and build blockhouses again.""I'm tired of block houses," replied the little boy, "and now thatmamma has promised me a picture-book like cousin Edie's I can'tthink of anything else.""Oh, well," said nurse, a little impatiently, "she'll be home ingood time. Try and not think of the book. It won't do any good--itwon't bring her home a minute sooner.""I can't help thinking of it," persisted the child, in whom theimaginative faculty was unusually, strong for one of his age.In a little while, however, something occurred to interest him, anda full hour elapsed before he again recurred to his mother and theexpected picture book. As best she could, his nurse diverted hismind, and kept him, in a measure, occupied with what was around him.At length it was full time for Mrs. Herbert to return. Eddy hadceased to find interest in anything appertaining to the nursery. Hewent down into the parlor, and seating himself at the window,watched, with childish eagerness, for the form of his mother.Strange as it may seem to the reader, Mrs. Herbert had scarcelypassed into the street, ere her promise was forgotten. Not that shewas indifferent to the happiness of her child--not that she was aheartless mother. Far very far from this. Purely and truly did shelove this sweet boy. But, so much were her thoughts interested inother things, that she did not, at the time, comprehend theearnestness of his childish wishes; nor think of her promise as asacred thing. The request for a picture book seemed to her but theexpression of a sudden thought, that passed from his mind as soon asuttered. And yet, she had not promised without intending to meet thewishes of her child, for she was an indulgent mother, and rarelysaid "No," to any request that might reasonably be gratified. Shehad noticed Cousin Edie's pretty book, and thought that she would,some time or other, get one like it for Eddy. The child's requestbut seconded this thought. There was will, therefore, in herpromise. She meant to do as she had said.But things of more interest to Mrs. Herbert, than the simple wish ofa child, so fully occupied her mind from the time she left her owndoor, that she never again thought of the book, until she saw Eddy'sdear face at the window. It was serious, and slightly impatient, asif he were wearied with watching and waiting; but the moment hiseyes rested upon her form, his whole countenance brightened, asthough lit up by a sunbeam. Almost as soon as Mrs. Herbert's handtouched the bell, the street door was thrown open, and the gladchild stood, like a rebuking spirit, before her."Where's my book, mamma? Give me my book, mamma! Oh, I'm so gladyou've come!"Now, the first conviction of wrong, often has an irritating effectupon the mind, obscuring its perceptions, and leading, sometimes, tothe impulsive commission of greater wrongs. It was so in the presentcase. The happy countenance of her child did not bring joy to themother's heart; for she knew that with a word, she must dash to theground all his buoyant anticipations. And she remembered, too, atthe moment, how poorly he could bear disappointment."Eddy, dear," said Mrs. Herbert, taking her little boy by the hand,and advancing toward the parlor door with him, "Eddy, dear, let metell you something."Her grave tone and look caused a shiver to pass inward toward theheart of the child. He understood, but too well, that the mother,whose word he had trusted so implicitly, had been faithless to herpromise.Poor child! even this advancing shadow of a coming disappointment,darkened his young face and filled his eyes with tears.Mrs. Herbert sat down on the nearest chair, as she entered theparlor, and drew Eddy to her side. She saw, from his sad face, thatwords were not required to make him aware that the promised book wasnot in her possession; and she knew, from former experience, thattrouble was before her. Unhappily, she did not feel softened, butrather irritated, toward the child."Eddy," she said firmly, yet with as much tenderness as she couldassume, "Eddy, you know you promised me to be such a good boy.""And I have been good," eagerly answered the little fellow, liftinghis swimming eyes to her face, "you may ask nurse if I havn't beengood all the time.""I'm sure you have," said Mrs. Herbert, touched by the manner of herchild; "and yet, Eddy, I have not brought your book."The tears, which had been ready to start, now gushed over his face,and a low cry pained the mother's ears."Eddy," said she, seriously, "let me tell you about it. You mustlisten to reason."Reason! poor, disappointed little one! He had no ear for thecomprehension of reasons."Now, Eddy! I can't have this!" Mrs. Herbert spoke firmly, foralready the child was weeping bitterly. "Crying will do no good. Ipromised you the book, and you shall have it. I had no opportunityto get it this morning. Come now! you must stop at once, or I----"Mrs. Herbert did not utter the threat which came to her lips; forher mind shrunk from the thought of punishing her child, especiallyas his fault was a consequence of her own actions. But, as hecontinued to cry on, and in a louder voice, she not only began tofeel excessively annoyed, but deemed it her duty to compel acessation of what could do no possible good, but rather harm."Eddy, you must stop this crying!" Firmness had changed tosternness.The words might as well not have been spoken."Then you are not going to stop!" The tones were angry now; and, asMrs. Herbert uttered them, she caught the arm of her child with atight grip.At this moment, the sound of the latch-key was heard in the streetdoor. It was dinner time, and Mr. Herbert entered."Bless us! what's the trouble here?" the father of Eddy exclaimed,good-naturedly, as he presented himself in the parlor."The trouble is," said Mrs. Herbert, in a fretful voice, "that Ipromised to buy him a book, and forgot all about it.""Oho! Is that all?" Mr. Herbert spoke cheerfully. "This trouble cansoon be healed. Come, dear, and let us see what I can do for you."And Mr. Herbert drew forth a small, square packet, and began untyingthe string, with which it was bound. Eddy ceased crying in aninstant, while a rainbow light shone through his tears. Soon a bookcame to view. It was the book. Singularly enough, Mr. Herbert had,that morning, observed it in a store, and thinking it would pleasehis child, had bought it for him."Will that do?" he said, handing the book to Eddy.What a gush of gladness came to the child's face. A moment or two hestood, like one bewildered, and then throwing his arms around hisfather's neck and hugging him tightly, he said, in the fullness ofhis heart,"Oh! you are a dear good papa! I do love you so much!"Ere the arms of Eddy were unclasped from his father's neck, Mrs.Herbert had left the room. When, on the ringing of the dinner bell,she joined her husband and child at the table, her countenance worea sober aspect, and there were signs of tears about her eyes. Whather thoughts had been, every true mother can better imagine than wedescribe. That they were salutary, may be inferred from the factthat no promise, not even the lightest, was ever afterwards made toher child, which was not righteously kept to the very letter.The Mother's Promise was featured as TheShort Story of the Day on Fri, May 11, 2018You may also enjoy our collection of 50 Great Feel-Good Stories.7.8 Add  The Mother's Promise to your library.Return to the T.S.

Shehad noticed Cousin Edie's pretty book, and thought that she would,some time or other, get one like it for Eddy. The child's requestbut seconded this thought. There was will, therefore, in herpromise. She meant to do as she had said.But things of more interest to Mrs. Herbert, than the simple wish ofa child, so fully occupied her mind from the time she left her owndoor, that she never again thought of the book, until she saw Eddy'sdear face at the window. It was serious, and slightly impatient, asif he were wearied with watching and waiting; but the moment hiseyes rested upon her form, his whole countenance brightened, asthough lit up by a sunbeam. Almost as soon as Mrs. Herbert's handtouched the bell, the street door was thrown open, and the gladchild stood, like a rebuking spirit, before her."Where's my book, mamma? Give me my book, mamma! Oh, I'm so gladyou've come!"Now, the first conviction of wrong, often has an irritating effectupon the mind, obscuring its perceptions, and leading, sometimes, tothe impulsive commission of greater wrongs. It was so in the presentcase. The happy countenance of her child did not bring joy to themother's heart; for she knew that with a word, she must dash to theground all his buoyant anticipations. And she remembered, too, atthe moment, how poorly he could bear disappointment."Eddy, dear," said Mrs. Herbert, taking her little boy by the hand,and advancing toward the parlor door with him, "Eddy, dear, let metell you something."Her grave tone and look caused a shiver to pass inward toward theheart of the child. He understood, but too well, that the mother,whose word he had trusted so implicitly, had been faithless to herpromise.Poor child! even this advancing shadow of a coming disappointment,darkened his young face and filled his eyes with tears.Mrs. Herbert sat down on the nearest chair, as she entered theparlor, and drew Eddy to her side. She saw, from his sad face, thatwords were not required to make him aware that the promised book wasnot in her possession; and she knew, from former experience, thattrouble was before her. Unhappily, she did not feel softened, butrather irritated, toward the child."Eddy," she said firmly, yet with as much tenderness as she couldassume, "Eddy, you know you promised me to be such a good boy.""And I have been good," eagerly answered the little fellow, liftinghis swimming eyes to her face, "you may ask nurse if I havn't beengood all the time.""I'm sure you have," said Mrs. Herbert, touched by the manner of herchild; "and yet, Eddy, I have not brought your book."The tears, which had been ready to start, now gushed over his face,and a low cry pained the mother's ears."Eddy," said she, seriously, "let me tell you about it. You mustlisten to reason."Reason! poor, disappointed little one! He had no ear for thecomprehension of reasons."Now, Eddy! I can't have this!" Mrs. Herbert spoke firmly, foralready the child was weeping bitterly. "Crying will do no good. Ipromised you the book, and you shall have it. I had no opportunityto get it this morning. Come now! you must stop at once, or I----"Mrs. Herbert did not utter the threat which came to her lips; forher mind shrunk from the thought of punishing her child, especiallyas his fault was a consequence of her own actions. But, as hecontinued to cry on, and in a louder voice, she not only began tofeel excessively annoyed, but deemed it her duty to compel acessation of what could do no possible good, but rather harm."Eddy, you must stop this crying!" Firmness had changed tosternness.The words might as well not have been spoken."Then you are not going to stop!" The tones were angry now; and, asMrs. Herbert uttered them, she caught the arm of her child with atight grip.At this moment, the sound of the latch-key was heard in the streetdoor. It was dinner time, and Mr. Herbert entered."Bless us! what's the trouble here?" the father of Eddy exclaimed,good-naturedly, as he presented himself in the parlor."The trouble is," said Mrs. Herbert, in a fretful voice, "that Ipromised to buy him a book, and forgot all about it.""Oho! Is that all?" Mr. Herbert spoke cheerfully. "This trouble cansoon be healed. Come, dear, and let us see what I can do for you."And Mr. Herbert drew forth a small, square packet, and began untyingthe string, with which it was bound. Eddy ceased crying in aninstant, while a rainbow light shone through his tears. Soon a bookcame to view. It was the book. Singularly enough, Mr. Herbert had,that morning, observed it in a store, and thinking it would pleasehis child, had bought it for him."Will that do?" he said, handing the book to Eddy.What a gush of gladness came to the child's face. A moment or two hestood, like one bewildered, and then throwing his arms around hisfather's neck and hugging him tightly, he said, in the fullness ofhis heart,"Oh! you are a dear good papa! I do love you so much!"Ere the arms of Eddy were unclasped from his father's neck, Mrs.Herbert had left the room. When, on the ringing of the dinner bell,she joined her husband and child at the table, her countenance worea sober aspect, and there were signs of tears about her eyes. Whather thoughts had been, every true mother can better imagine than wedescribe.

Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Portrait Mrs. Herbert kissed her darling boy again, and then went forth tomake her morning round of calls. Eddy returned to the nursery,strong in his purpose, to be a good boy, as he had promised."Such a dear little picture-book as mamma is going to bring mehome," he said to nurse, as he leaned his arms against her, andlooked up into her face. "Oh! won't I be so glad. It's to be justlike cousin Edie's. Mamma said so; and cousin Edie's book is sobeautiful. I 've wanted one ever since I was there. Is'nt mammagood?""Yes, Eddy," replied the nurse, "your mamma is very good; and youshould love her so much, and do everything she tells you to do.""I do love her," said the child. "Oh, I love her more than all theworld; and I'm going to mind every thing she says."Then the child went to his play, and was happy with his toys. Buthis thoughts were on the picture-book, and pleasantly his youngimagination lingered amid its attractive pages."Is'nt it 'most time for mother to be home?" he asked, at the end ofhalf an hour, coming to the side of his nurse, and gazing up intoher face."Why no, child," replied the nurse, "not for a long while yet."Eddy looked disappointed. But that instant the door bell rung."There's mamma!" exclaimed the child, clapping his hands; and beforenurse could restrain him, he had bounded from the room, and hislittle feet were heard pattering down the stairs. Slowly he cameback, after a little while, and with a look of disappointment on hissweet young face, entered the nursery, saying, as he did so:"It was only a man with brooms to sell.""Your mamma won't be home for a long time yet, Eddy," said hisnurse, "so it is of no use for you to expect her. Go and build blockhouses again.""I'm tired of block houses," replied the little boy, "and now thatmamma has promised me a picture-book like cousin Edie's I can'tthink of anything else.""Oh, well," said nurse, a little impatiently, "she'll be home ingood time. Try and not think of the book. It won't do any good--itwon't bring her home a minute sooner.""I can't help thinking of it," persisted the child, in whom theimaginative faculty was unusually, strong for one of his age.In a little while, however, something occurred to interest him, anda full hour elapsed before he again recurred to his mother and theexpected picture book. As best she could, his nurse diverted hismind, and kept him, in a measure, occupied with what was around him.At length it was full time for Mrs. Herbert to return. Eddy hadceased to find interest in anything appertaining to the nursery.

Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Portrait "I do love her," said the child. "Oh, I love her more than all theworld; and I'm going to mind every thing she says."Then the child went to his play, and was happy with his toys. Buthis thoughts were on the picture-book, and pleasantly his youngimagination lingered amid its attractive pages."Is'nt it 'most time for mother to be home?" he asked, at the end ofhalf an hour, coming to the side of his nurse, and gazing up intoher face."Why no, child," replied the nurse, "not for a long while yet."Eddy looked disappointed. But that instant the door bell rung."There's mamma!" exclaimed the child, clapping his hands; and beforenurse could restrain him, he had bounded from the room, and hislittle feet were heard pattering down the stairs. Slowly he cameback, after a little while, and with a look of disappointment on hissweet young face, entered the nursery, saying, as he did so:"It was only a man with brooms to sell.""Your mamma won't be home for a long time yet, Eddy," said hisnurse, "so it is of no use for you to expect her. Go and build blockhouses again.""I'm tired of block houses," replied the little boy, "and now thatmamma has promised me a picture-book like cousin Edie's I can'tthink of anything else.""Oh, well," said nurse, a little impatiently, "she'll be home ingood time. Try and not think of the book. It won't do any good--itwon't bring her home a minute sooner.""I can't help thinking of it," persisted the child, in whom theimaginative faculty was unusually, strong for one of his age.In a little while, however, something occurred to interest him, anda full hour elapsed before he again recurred to his mother and theexpected picture book. As best she could, his nurse diverted hismind, and kept him, in a measure, occupied with what was around him.At length it was full time for Mrs. Herbert to return. Eddy hadceased to find interest in anything appertaining to the nursery. Hewent down into the parlor, and seating himself at the window,watched, with childish eagerness, for the form of his mother.Strange as it may seem to the reader, Mrs. Herbert had scarcelypassed into the street, ere her promise was forgotten. Not that shewas indifferent to the happiness of her child--not that she was aheartless mother. Far very far from this. Purely and truly did shelove this sweet boy. But, so much were her thoughts interested inother things, that she did not, at the time, comprehend theearnestness of his childish wishes; nor think of her promise as asacred thing. The request for a picture book seemed to her but theexpression of a sudden thought, that passed from his mind as soon asuttered. And yet, she had not promised without intending to meet thewishes of her child, for she was an indulgent mother, and rarelysaid "No," to any request that might reasonably be gratified. Shehad noticed Cousin Edie's pretty book, and thought that she would,some time or other, get one like it for Eddy. The child's requestbut seconded this thought. There was will, therefore, in herpromise. She meant to do as she had said.But things of more interest to Mrs. Herbert, than the simple wish ofa child, so fully occupied her mind from the time she left her owndoor, that she never again thought of the book, until she saw Eddy'sdear face at the window. It was serious, and slightly impatient, asif he were wearied with watching and waiting; but the moment hiseyes rested upon her form, his whole countenance brightened, asthough lit up by a sunbeam. Almost as soon as Mrs. Herbert's handtouched the bell, the street door was thrown open, and the gladchild stood, like a rebuking spirit, before her."Where's my book, mamma? Give me my book, mamma! Oh, I'm so gladyou've come!"Now, the first conviction of wrong, often has an irritating effectupon the mind, obscuring its perceptions, and leading, sometimes, tothe impulsive commission of greater wrongs. It was so in the presentcase. The happy countenance of her child did not bring joy to themother's heart; for she knew that with a word, she must dash to theground all his buoyant anticipations. And she remembered, too, atthe moment, how poorly he could bear disappointment."Eddy, dear," said Mrs. Herbert, taking her little boy by the hand,and advancing toward the parlor door with him, "Eddy, dear, let metell you something."Her grave tone and look caused a shiver to pass inward toward theheart of the child. He understood, but too well, that the mother,whose word he had trusted so implicitly, had been faithless to herpromise.Poor child! even this advancing shadow of a coming disappointment,darkened his young face and filled his eyes with tears.Mrs. Herbert sat down on the nearest chair, as she entered theparlor, and drew Eddy to her side. She saw, from his sad face, thatwords were not required to make him aware that the promised book wasnot in her possession; and she knew, from former experience, thattrouble was before her. Unhappily, she did not feel softened, butrather irritated, toward the child."Eddy," she said firmly, yet with as much tenderness as she couldassume, "Eddy, you know you promised me to be such a good boy.""And I have been good," eagerly answered the little fellow, liftinghis swimming eyes to her face, "you may ask nurse if I havn't beengood all the time.""I'm sure you have," said Mrs. Herbert, touched by the manner of herchild; "and yet, Eddy, I have not brought your book."The tears, which had been ready to start, now gushed over his face,and a low cry pained the mother's ears."Eddy," said she, seriously, "let me tell you about it. You mustlisten to reason."Reason! poor, disappointed little one! He had no ear for thecomprehension of reasons."Now, Eddy! I can't have this!" Mrs. Herbert spoke firmly, foralready the child was weeping bitterly. "Crying will do no good. Ipromised you the book, and you shall have it. I had no opportunityto get it this morning. Come now! you must stop at once, or I----"Mrs. Herbert did not utter the threat which came to her lips; forher mind shrunk from the thought of punishing her child, especiallyas his fault was a consequence of her own actions. But, as hecontinued to cry on, and in a louder voice, she not only began tofeel excessively annoyed, but deemed it her duty to compel acessation of what could do no possible good, but rather harm."Eddy, you must stop this crying!" Firmness had changed tosternness.The words might as well not have been spoken."Then you are not going to stop!" The tones were angry now; and, asMrs. Herbert uttered them, she caught the arm of her child with atight grip.At this moment, the sound of the latch-key was heard in the streetdoor. It was dinner time, and Mr. Herbert entered."Bless us! what's the trouble here?" the father of Eddy exclaimed,good-naturedly, as he presented himself in the parlor."The trouble is," said Mrs. Herbert, in a fretful voice, "that Ipromised to buy him a book, and forgot all about it.""Oho! Is that all?" Mr. Herbert spoke cheerfully. "This trouble cansoon be healed. Come, dear, and let us see what I can do for you."And Mr. Herbert drew forth a small, square packet, and began untyingthe string, with which it was bound. Eddy ceased crying in aninstant, while a rainbow light shone through his tears. Soon a bookcame to view. It was the book. Singularly enough, Mr. Herbert had,that morning, observed it in a store, and thinking it would pleasehis child, had bought it for him."Will that do?" he said, handing the book to Eddy.What a gush of gladness came to the child's face. A moment or two hestood, like one bewildered, and then throwing his arms around hisfather's neck and hugging him tightly, he said, in the fullness ofhis heart,"Oh! you are a dear good papa! I do love you so much!"Ere the arms of Eddy were unclasped from his father's neck, Mrs.Herbert had left the room. When, on the ringing of the dinner bell,she joined her husband and child at the table, her countenance worea sober aspect, and there were signs of tears about her eyes.

I do love you so much!"Ere the arms of Eddy were unclasped from his father's neck, Mrs.Herbert had left the room. When, on the ringing of the dinner bell,she joined her husband and child at the table, her countenance worea sober aspect, and there were signs of tears about her eyes.

Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Portrait Eddy looked disappointed. But that instant the door bell rung."There's mamma!" exclaimed the child, clapping his hands; and beforenurse could restrain him, he had bounded from the room, and hislittle feet were heard pattering down the stairs. Slowly he cameback, after a little while, and with a look of disappointment on hissweet young face, entered the nursery, saying, as he did so:"It was only a man with brooms to sell.""Your mamma won't be home for a long time yet, Eddy," said hisnurse, "so it is of no use for you to expect her. Go and build blockhouses again.""I'm tired of block houses," replied the little boy, "and now thatmamma has promised me a picture-book like cousin Edie's I can'tthink of anything else.""Oh, well," said nurse, a little impatiently, "she'll be home ingood time. Try and not think of the book. It won't do any good--itwon't bring her home a minute sooner.""I can't help thinking of it," persisted the child, in whom theimaginative faculty was unusually, strong for one of his age.In a little while, however, something occurred to interest him, anda full hour elapsed before he again recurred to his mother and theexpected picture book. As best she could, his nurse diverted hismind, and kept him, in a measure, occupied with what was around him.At length it was full time for Mrs. Herbert to return. Eddy hadceased to find interest in anything appertaining to the nursery. Hewent down into the parlor, and seating himself at the window,watched, with childish eagerness, for the form of his mother.Strange as it may seem to the reader, Mrs. Herbert had scarcelypassed into the street, ere her promise was forgotten. Not that shewas indifferent to the happiness of her child--not that she was aheartless mother. Far very far from this. Purely and truly did shelove this sweet boy. But, so much were her thoughts interested inother things, that she did not, at the time, comprehend theearnestness of his childish wishes; nor think of her promise as asacred thing. The request for a picture book seemed to her but theexpression of a sudden thought, that passed from his mind as soon asuttered. And yet, she had not promised without intending to meet thewishes of her child, for she was an indulgent mother, and rarelysaid "No," to any request that might reasonably be gratified. Shehad noticed Cousin Edie's pretty book, and thought that she would,some time or other, get one like it for Eddy. The child's requestbut seconded this thought. There was will, therefore, in herpromise. She meant to do as she had said.But things of more interest to Mrs. Herbert, than the simple wish ofa child, so fully occupied her mind from the time she left her owndoor, that she never again thought of the book, until she saw Eddy'sdear face at the window. It was serious, and slightly impatient, asif he were wearied with watching and waiting; but the moment hiseyes rested upon her form, his whole countenance brightened, asthough lit up by a sunbeam. Almost as soon as Mrs. Herbert's handtouched the bell, the street door was thrown open, and the gladchild stood, like a rebuking spirit, before her."Where's my book, mamma? Give me my book, mamma! Oh, I'm so gladyou've come!"Now, the first conviction of wrong, often has an irritating effectupon the mind, obscuring its perceptions, and leading, sometimes, tothe impulsive commission of greater wrongs. It was so in the presentcase. The happy countenance of her child did not bring joy to themother's heart; for she knew that with a word, she must dash to theground all his buoyant anticipations. And she remembered, too, atthe moment, how poorly he could bear disappointment."Eddy, dear," said Mrs. Herbert, taking her little boy by the hand,and advancing toward the parlor door with him, "Eddy, dear, let metell you something."Her grave tone and look caused a shiver to pass inward toward theheart of the child. He understood, but too well, that the mother,whose word he had trusted so implicitly, had been faithless to herpromise.Poor child! even this advancing shadow of a coming disappointment,darkened his young face and filled his eyes with tears.Mrs. Herbert sat down on the nearest chair, as she entered theparlor, and drew Eddy to her side. She saw, from his sad face, thatwords were not required to make him aware that the promised book wasnot in her possession; and she knew, from former experience, thattrouble was before her. Unhappily, she did not feel softened, butrather irritated, toward the child."Eddy," she said firmly, yet with as much tenderness as she couldassume, "Eddy, you know you promised me to be such a good boy.""And I have been good," eagerly answered the little fellow, liftinghis swimming eyes to her face, "you may ask nurse if I havn't beengood all the time.""I'm sure you have," said Mrs. Herbert, touched by the manner of herchild; "and yet, Eddy, I have not brought your book."The tears, which had been ready to start, now gushed over his face,and a low cry pained the mother's ears."Eddy," said she, seriously, "let me tell you about it. You mustlisten to reason."Reason! poor, disappointed little one! He had no ear for thecomprehension of reasons."Now, Eddy! I can't have this!" Mrs. Herbert spoke firmly, foralready the child was weeping bitterly. "Crying will do no good. Ipromised you the book, and you shall have it. I had no opportunityto get it this morning. Come now! you must stop at once, or I----"Mrs. Herbert did not utter the threat which came to her lips; forher mind shrunk from the thought of punishing her child, especiallyas his fault was a consequence of her own actions. But, as hecontinued to cry on, and in a louder voice, she not only began tofeel excessively annoyed, but deemed it her duty to compel acessation of what could do no possible good, but rather harm."Eddy, you must stop this crying!" Firmness had changed tosternness.The words might as well not have been spoken."Then you are not going to stop!" The tones were angry now; and, asMrs. Herbert uttered them, she caught the arm of her child with atight grip.At this moment, the sound of the latch-key was heard in the streetdoor. It was dinner time, and Mr. Herbert entered."Bless us! what's the trouble here?" the father of Eddy exclaimed,good-naturedly, as he presented himself in the parlor."The trouble is," said Mrs. Herbert, in a fretful voice, "that Ipromised to buy him a book, and forgot all about it.""Oho! Is that all?" Mr. Herbert spoke cheerfully. "This trouble cansoon be healed. Come, dear, and let us see what I can do for you."And Mr. Herbert drew forth a small, square packet, and began untyingthe string, with which it was bound. Eddy ceased crying in aninstant, while a rainbow light shone through his tears. Soon a bookcame to view. It was the book. Singularly enough, Mr. Herbert had,that morning, observed it in a store, and thinking it would pleasehis child, had bought it for him."Will that do?" he said, handing the book to Eddy.What a gush of gladness came to the child's face.

It won't do any good--itwon't bring her home a minute sooner.""I can't help thinking of it," persisted the child, in whom theimaginative faculty was unusually, strong for one of his age.In a little while, however, something occurred to interest him, anda full hour elapsed before he again recurred to his mother and theexpected picture book. As best she could, his nurse diverted hismind, and kept him, in a measure, occupied with what was around him.At length it was full time for Mrs. Herbert to return. Eddy hadceased to find interest in anything appertaining to the nursery. Hewent down into the parlor, and seating himself at the window,watched, with childish eagerness, for the form of his mother.Strange as it may seem to the reader, Mrs. Herbert had scarcelypassed into the street, ere her promise was forgotten. Not that shewas indifferent to the happiness of her child--not that she was aheartless mother. Far very far from this. Purely and truly did shelove this sweet boy. But, so much were her thoughts interested inother things, that she did not, at the time, comprehend theearnestness of his childish wishes; nor think of her promise as asacred thing. The request for a picture book seemed to her but theexpression of a sudden thought, that passed from his mind as soon asuttered. And yet, she had not promised without intending to meet thewishes of her child, for she was an indulgent mother, and rarelysaid "No," to any request that might reasonably be gratified. Shehad noticed Cousin Edie's pretty book, and thought that she would,some time or other, get one like it for Eddy. The child's requestbut seconded this thought. There was will, therefore, in herpromise. She meant to do as she had said.But things of more interest to Mrs. Herbert, than the simple wish ofa child, so fully occupied her mind from the time she left her owndoor, that she never again thought of the book, until she saw Eddy'sdear face at the window. It was serious, and slightly impatient, asif he were wearied with watching and waiting; but the moment hiseyes rested upon her form, his whole countenance brightened, asthough lit up by a sunbeam. Almost as soon as Mrs. Herbert's handtouched the bell, the street door was thrown open, and the gladchild stood, like a rebuking spirit, before her."Where's my book, mamma? Give me my book, mamma! Oh, I'm so gladyou've come!"Now, the first conviction of wrong, often has an irritating effectupon the mind, obscuring its perceptions, and leading, sometimes, tothe impulsive commission of greater wrongs. It was so in the presentcase. The happy countenance of her child did not bring joy to themother's heart; for she knew that with a word, she must dash to theground all his buoyant anticipations. And she remembered, too, atthe moment, how poorly he could bear disappointment."Eddy, dear," said Mrs. Herbert, taking her little boy by the hand,and advancing toward the parlor door with him, "Eddy, dear, let metell you something."Her grave tone and look caused a shiver to pass inward toward theheart of the child. He understood, but too well, that the mother,whose word he had trusted so implicitly, had been faithless to herpromise.Poor child! even this advancing shadow of a coming disappointment,darkened his young face and filled his eyes with tears.Mrs. Herbert sat down on the nearest chair, as she entered theparlor, and drew Eddy to her side. She saw, from his sad face, thatwords were not required to make him aware that the promised book wasnot in her possession; and she knew, from former experience, thattrouble was before her. Unhappily, she did not feel softened, butrather irritated, toward the child."Eddy," she said firmly, yet with as much tenderness as she couldassume, "Eddy, you know you promised me to be such a good boy.""And I have been good," eagerly answered the little fellow, liftinghis swimming eyes to her face, "you may ask nurse if I havn't beengood all the time.""I'm sure you have," said Mrs. Herbert, touched by the manner of herchild; "and yet, Eddy, I have not brought your book."The tears, which had been ready to start, now gushed over his face,and a low cry pained the mother's ears."Eddy," said she, seriously, "let me tell you about it. You mustlisten to reason."Reason! poor, disappointed little one! He had no ear for thecomprehension of reasons."Now, Eddy! I can't have this!" Mrs. Herbert spoke firmly, foralready the child was weeping bitterly. "Crying will do no good. Ipromised you the book, and you shall have it. I had no opportunityto get it this morning. Come now! you must stop at once, or I----"Mrs. Herbert did not utter the threat which came to her lips; forher mind shrunk from the thought of punishing her child, especiallyas his fault was a consequence of her own actions. But, as hecontinued to cry on, and in a louder voice, she not only began tofeel excessively annoyed, but deemed it her duty to compel acessation of what could do no possible good, but rather harm."Eddy, you must stop this crying!" Firmness had changed tosternness.The words might as well not have been spoken."Then you are not going to stop!" The tones were angry now; and, asMrs. Herbert uttered them, she caught the arm of her child with atight grip.At this moment, the sound of the latch-key was heard in the streetdoor. It was dinner time, and Mr. Herbert entered."Bless us! what's the trouble here?" the father of Eddy exclaimed,good-naturedly, as he presented himself in the parlor."The trouble is," said Mrs. Herbert, in a fretful voice, "that Ipromised to buy him a book, and forgot all about it.""Oho! Is that all?" Mr. Herbert spoke cheerfully. "This trouble cansoon be healed. Come, dear, and let us see what I can do for you."And Mr. Herbert drew forth a small, square packet, and began untyingthe string, with which it was bound. Eddy ceased crying in aninstant, while a rainbow light shone through his tears. Soon a bookcame to view. It was the book. Singularly enough, Mr. Herbert had,that morning, observed it in a store, and thinking it would pleasehis child, had bought it for him."Will that do?" he said, handing the book to Eddy.What a gush of gladness came to the child's face. A moment or two hestood, like one bewildered, and then throwing his arms around hisfather's neck and hugging him tightly, he said, in the fullness ofhis heart,"Oh! you are a dear good papa! I do love you so much!"Ere the arms of Eddy were unclasped from his father's neck, Mrs.Herbert had left the room. When, on the ringing of the dinner bell,she joined her husband and child at the table, her countenance worea sober aspect, and there were signs of tears about her eyes. Whather thoughts had been, every true mother can better imagine than wedescribe.

But, as hecontinued to cry on, and in a louder voice, she not only began tofeel excessively annoyed, but deemed it her duty to compel acessation of what could do no possible good, but rather harm."Eddy, you must stop this crying!" Firmness had changed tosternness.The words might as well not have been spoken."Then you are not going to stop!" The tones were angry now; and, asMrs. Herbert uttered them, she caught the arm of her child with atight grip.At this moment, the sound of the latch-key was heard in the streetdoor. It was dinner time, and Mr. Herbert entered."Bless us! what's the trouble here?" the father of Eddy exclaimed,good-naturedly, as he presented himself in the parlor."The trouble is," said Mrs. Herbert, in a fretful voice, "that Ipromised to buy him a book, and forgot all about it.""Oho! Is that all?" Mr. Herbert spoke cheerfully. "This trouble cansoon be healed. Come, dear, and let us see what I can do for you."And Mr. Herbert drew forth a small, square packet, and began untyingthe string, with which it was bound. Eddy ceased crying in aninstant, while a rainbow light shone through his tears. Soon a bookcame to view. It was the book. Singularly enough, Mr. Herbert had,that morning, observed it in a store, and thinking it would pleasehis child, had bought it for him."Will that do?" he said, handing the book to Eddy.What a gush of gladness came to the child's face. A moment or two hestood, like one bewildered, and then throwing his arms around hisfather's neck and hugging him tightly, he said, in the fullness ofhis heart,"Oh! you are a dear good papa! I do love you so much!"Ere the arms of Eddy were unclasped from his father's neck, Mrs.Herbert had left the room. When, on the ringing of the dinner bell,she joined her husband and child at the table, her countenance worea sober aspect, and there were signs of tears about her eyes.

Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; The Portrait But things of more interest to Mrs. Herbert, than the simple wish ofa child, so fully occupied her mind from the time she left her owndoor, that she never again thought of the book, until she saw Eddy'sdear face at the window. It was serious, and slightly impatient, asif he were wearied with watching and waiting; but the moment hiseyes rested upon her form, his whole countenance brightened, asthough lit up by a sunbeam. Almost as soon as Mrs. Herbert's handtouched the bell, the street door was thrown open, and the gladchild stood, like a rebuking spirit, before her."Where's my book, mamma? Give me my book, mamma! Oh, I'm so gladyou've come!"Now, the first conviction of wrong, often has an irritating effectupon the mind, obscuring its perceptions, and leading, sometimes, tothe impulsive commission of greater wrongs. It was so in the presentcase. The happy countenance of her child did not bring joy to themother's heart; for she knew that with a word, she must dash to theground all his buoyant anticipations. And she remembered, too, atthe moment, how poorly he could bear disappointment."Eddy, dear," said Mrs. Herbert, taking her little boy by the hand,and advancing toward the parlor door with him, "Eddy, dear, let metell you something."Her grave tone and look caused a shiver to pass inward toward theheart of the child. He understood, but too well, that the mother,whose word he had trusted so implicitly, had been faithless to herpromise.Poor child! even this advancing shadow of a coming disappointment,darkened his young face and filled his eyes with tears.Mrs. Herbert sat down on the nearest chair, as she entered theparlor, and drew Eddy to her side. She saw, from his sad face, thatwords were not required to make him aware that the promised book wasnot in her possession; and she knew, from former experience, thattrouble was before her. Unhappily, she did not feel softened, butrather irritated, toward the child."Eddy," she said firmly, yet with as much tenderness as she couldassume, "Eddy, you know you promised me to be such a good boy.""And I have been good," eagerly answered the little fellow, liftinghis swimming eyes to her face, "you may ask nurse if I havn't beengood all the time.""I'm sure you have," said Mrs. Herbert, touched by the manner of herchild; "and yet, Eddy, I have not brought your book."The tears, which had been ready to start, now gushed over his face,and a low cry pained the mother's ears."Eddy," said she, seriously, "let me tell you about it. You mustlisten to reason."Reason! poor, disappointed little one! He had no ear for thecomprehension of reasons."Now, Eddy! I can't have this!" Mrs. Herbert spoke firmly, foralready the child was weeping bitterly. "Crying will do no good. Ipromised you the book, and you shall have it. I had no opportunityto get it this morning.

The tones were angry now; and, asMrs. Herbert uttered them, she caught the arm of her child with atight grip.At this moment, the sound of the latch-key was heard in the streetdoor. It was dinner time, and Mr. Herbert entered."Bless us! what's the trouble here?" the father of Eddy exclaimed,good-naturedly, as he presented himself in the parlor."The trouble is," said Mrs. Herbert, in a fretful voice, "that Ipromised to buy him a book, and forgot all about it.""Oho! Is that all?" Mr. Herbert spoke cheerfully. "This trouble cansoon be healed. Come, dear, and let us see what I can do for you."And Mr. Herbert drew forth a small, square packet, and began untyingthe string, with which it was bound. Eddy ceased crying in aninstant, while a rainbow light shone through his tears. Soon a bookcame to view. It was the book. Singularly enough, Mr. Herbert had,that morning, observed it in a store, and thinking it would pleasehis child, had bought it for him."Will that do?" he said, handing the book to Eddy.What a gush of gladness came to the child's face. A moment or two hestood, like one bewildered, and then throwing his arms around hisfather's neck and hugging him tightly, he said, in the fullness ofhis heart,"Oh! you are a dear good papa! I do love you so much!"Ere the arms of Eddy were unclasped from his father's neck, Mrs.Herbert had left the room. When, on the ringing of the dinner bell,she joined her husband and child at the table, her countenance worea sober aspect, and there were signs of tears about her eyes.

You mustlisten to reason."Reason! poor, disappointed little one! He had no ear for thecomprehension of reasons."Now, Eddy! I can't have this!" Mrs. Herbert spoke firmly, foralready the child was weeping bitterly. "Crying will do no good. Ipromised you the book, and you shall have it. I had no opportunityto get it this morning. Come now! you must stop at once, or I----"Mrs. Herbert did not utter the threat which came to her lips; forher mind shrunk from the thought of punishing her child, especiallyas his fault was a consequence of her own actions.

It was dinner time, and Mr. Herbert entered."Bless us! what's the trouble here?" the father of Eddy exclaimed,good-naturedly, as he presented himself in the parlor."The trouble is," said Mrs. Herbert, in a fretful voice, "that Ipromised to buy him a book, and forgot all about it.""Oho! Is that all?" Mr. Herbert spoke cheerfully. "This trouble cansoon be healed. Come, dear, and let us see what I can do for you."And Mr. Herbert drew forth a small, square packet, and began untyingthe string, with which it was bound.

Singularly enough, Mr. Herbert had,that morning, observed it in a store, and thinking it would pleasehis child, had bought it for him."Will that do?" he said, handing the book to Eddy.What a gush of gladness came to the child's face. A moment or two hestood, like one bewildered, and then throwing his arms around hisfather's neck and hugging him tightly, he said, in the fullness ofhis heart,"Oh! you are a dear good papa! I do love you so much!"Ere the arms of Eddy were unclasped from his father's neck, Mrs.Herbert had left the room. When, on the ringing of the dinner bell,she joined her husband and child at the table, her countenance worea sober aspect, and there were signs of tears about her eyes.
