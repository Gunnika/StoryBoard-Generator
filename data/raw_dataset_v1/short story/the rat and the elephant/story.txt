As Mr. Rat walked along—he kept mostly to the ditch—henoticed a great commotion up the road, and soon a grandprocession came in view. It was the King and his retinue. The King rode on a huge Elephant adorned with the most gorgeoustrappings. With the King in his luxurious howdah were the royalDog and Cat. A great crowd of people followed the procession.They were so taken up with admiration of the Elephant, that theRat was not noticed. His pride was hurt. "What fools!" he cried. "Look at me, and you will soon forgetthat clumsy Elephant! Is it his great size that makes your eyespop out? Or is it his wrinkled hide? Why, I have eyes and earsand as many legs as he! I am of just as much importance, and"— But just then the royal Cat spied him, and the next instant, theRat knew he was not quite so important as an Elephant.
