An Ass and a Fox had become close comrades, and were constantlyin each other's company. While the Ass cropped a fresh bit ofgreens, the Fox would devour a chicken from the neighboringfarmyard or a bit of cheese filched from the dairy. One day thepair unexpectedly met a Lion. The Ass was very much frightened,but the Fox calmed his fears. "I will talk to him," he said. So the Fox walked boldly up to the Lion. "Your highness," he said in an undertone, so the Ass could nothear him, "I've got a fine scheme in my head. If you promise notto hurt me, I will lead that foolish creature yonder into a pitwhere he can't get out, and you can feast at your pleasure." The Lion agreed and the Fox returned to the Ass. "I made him promise not to hurt us," said the Fox. "But come, Iknow a good place to hide till he is gone." So the Fox led the Ass into a deep pit. But when the Lion sawthat the Ass was his for the taking, he first of all struck downthe traitor Fox. Traitors may expect treachery. 8.1 Add  The Ass The Fox And The Lion to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
