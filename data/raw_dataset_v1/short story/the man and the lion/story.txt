A Lion and a Man chanced to travel in company through the forest.They soon began to quarrel, for each of them boasted that he andhis kind were far superior to the other both in strength andmind. Now they reached a clearing in the forest and there stood astatue. It was a representation of Heracles in the act of tearingthe jaws of the Nemean Lion. "See," said the man, "that's how strong we are! The King ofBeasts is like wax in our hands!" "Ho!" laughed the Lion, "a Man made that statue. It would havebeen quite a different scene had a Lion made it!" It all depends on the point of view, and who tells the story. 9.0 Add  The Man And The Lion to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
