A Lion had grown very old. His teeth were worn away. His limbscould no longer bear him, and the King of Beasts was very pitifulindeed as he lay gasping on the ground, about to die. Where now his strength and his former graceful beauty? Now a Boar spied him, and rushing at him, gored him with hisyellow tusk. A Bull trampled him with his heavy hoofs. Even acontemptible Ass let fly his heels and brayed his insults in theface of the Lion. It is cowardly to attack the defenseless, though he be anenemy. 8.3 Add  The Old Lion to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
