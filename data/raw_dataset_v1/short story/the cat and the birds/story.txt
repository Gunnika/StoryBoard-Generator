A Cat was growing very thin. As you have guessed, he did not getenough to eat. One day he heard that some Birds in theneighborhood were ailing and needed a doctor. So he put on a pairof spectacles, and with a leather box in his hand, knocked at thedoor of the Bird's home. The Birds peeped out, and Dr. Cat, with much solicitude, askedhow they were. He would be very happy to give them some medicine. "Tweet, tweet," laughed the Birds. "Very smart, aren't you? Weare very well, thank you, and more so, if you only keep awayfrom here." Be wise and shun the quack. 8.3 Add  The Cat And The Birds to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
