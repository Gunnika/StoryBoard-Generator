Two Travelers were walking along the seashore. Far out they sawsomething riding on the waves. "Look," said one, "a great ship rides in from distant lands,bearing rich treasures!" The object they saw came ever nearer the shore. "No," said the other, "that is not a treasure ship. That is somefisherman's skiff, with the day's catch of savoury fish." Still nearer came the object. The waves washed it up on shore. "It is a chest of gold lost from some wreck," they cried. BothTravelers rushed to the beach, but there they found nothing but awater-soaked log. Do not let your hopes carry you away from reality. 8.3 Add  The Travelers And The Sea to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
