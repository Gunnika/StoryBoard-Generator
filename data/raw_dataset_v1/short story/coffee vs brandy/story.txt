"We shall have to give them a wedding party," said Mrs. Eldridge toher husband.Mr. Eldridge assented."They will be home to-morrow, and I think of sending out ofinvitations for Thursday.""As you like about that," replied Mr. Eldridge. "The trouble will beyours.""You have no objections?""O, none in the world. Fanny is a good little girl, and the least wecan do is to pay her this compliment on her marriage. I am notaltogether satisfied about her husband, however; he was rather awild sort of a boy a year or two ago.""I guess he's all right now," remarked Mrs. Eldridge; "and hestrikes me as a very kind-hearted, well-meaning young man. I haveflattered myself that Fanny has done quite well as the average runof girls.""Perhaps so," said Mr. Eldridge, a little thoughtfully."Will you be in the neighborhood of Snyder's?" inquired the lady."I think not. We are very busy just now, and I shall hardly havetime to leave the store to-day. But I can step around thereto-morrow.""To-morrow, or even the next day, will answer," replied Mrs.Eldridge. "You must order the liquors. I will attend to everythingelse.""How many are you going to invite?" inquired Mr. Eldridge."I have not made out a list yet, but it will not fall much short ofseventy or eighty.""Seventy or eighty!" repeated Mr. Eldridge."Let me see. Three dozen of champagne; a dozen of sherry; a dozen ofport; a dozen of hock, and a gallon of brandy,--that will be enoughto put life into them I imagine.""Or death!" Mrs. Eldridge spoke to herself, in an undertone.Her husband, if he noticed the remark, did not reply to it, butsaid, "Good morning," and left the house. A lad about sixteen yearsof age sat in the room during this conversation, with a book in hishand and his eyes on the page before him. He did not once look up ormove; and an observer would have supposed him so much interested inhis book as not to have heard the passing conversation. But he hadlistened to every word. As soon as Mr. Eldridge left the room hisbook fell upon his lap, and looking towards Mrs. Eldridge, he said,in an earnest but respectful manner,--"Don't have any liquor, mother."Mrs s Eldridge looked neither offended nor irritated by thisremonstrance, as she replied,--"I wish it were possible to avoid having liquor, my son; but it isthe custom of society and if we give a party it must be in the wayit is done by other people."This did not satisfy the boy, who had been for some time associatedwith the Cadets of Temperance, and he answered, but with modesty andgreat respect of, manner,--"If other people do wrong, mother--whatthen?""I am not so sure of its being wrong, Henry.""O, but mother," spoke out the boy, quickly, "if it hurts people todrink, it must be wrong to give them liquor. Now I've been thinkinghow much better it would be to have a nice cup of coffee. I am surethat four out of five would like it a great deal better than wine orbrandy. And nobody could possibly receive any harm. Didn't you hearwhat father said about Mr. Lewis? That he had been rather wild? I amsure I shall never forget seeing him stagger in the street once. Isuppose he has reformed. But just think, if the taste should berevived again and at our house, and he should become intoxicated atthis wedding party! O, mother! It makes me feel dreadfully to thinkabout it. And dear Cousin Fanny! What sorrow it would bring to her!""O, dear, Henry! Don't talk in that kind of a way! You make meshudder all over. You're getting too much carried away by thissubject of temperance"And Mrs. Eldridge left the room to look after her domestic duties.But she could not push from her mind certain uneasy thoughts whichher son's suggestions had awakened. During the morning an intimatelady friend came in to whom Mrs. Eldridge spoke of the intendedparty."And would you believe it," she said, "that old-fashioned boy ofmine actually proposed that we should have coffee instead of wineand brandy.""And you're going to adopt the suggestion," replied the lady, herface lighten up with a pleasant smile."It would suit my own views exactly; but then such an innovationupon a common usage as that; is not to be thought of for a moment.""And why not?" asked the lady. "Coffee is safe, while wine andbrandy are always dangerous in promiscuous companies. You can nevertell in what morbid appetite you may excite an unhealthy craving.You may receive into your house a young man with intellect clear,and moral purposes well-balanced, and send him home at midnight, tohis mother, stupid from intoxication! Take your son's advice, myfriend. Exclude the wine and brandy, and give a pleasant cup ofcoffee to your guests instead.""O, dear, no, I can't do that!" said Mrs. Eldridge. "It would lookas if we were too mean to furnish wines and brandy. Besides, myhusband would never consent to it.""Let me give you a little experience of my own. It may help you to aright decision in this case."The lady spoke with some earnestness, and a sober cast of thought inher countenance. "It is now about three years since I gave a largeparty, at which a number of young men were present,--boys I shouldrather say. Among these was the son of an old and very dear friend.He was in his nineteenth year,--a handsome, intelligent, and mostagreeable person--full of life and pleasant humor. At supper time Inoticed him with a glass of champagne in his hand, gayly talkingwith some ladies. In a little while after, my eyes happening to reston him, I saw him holding, a glass of port wine to his lips, whichwas emptied at a single draught. Again passing near him, in order tospeak to a lady, I observed a tumbler in his hand, and knew thecontents to be brandy and water. This caused me to feel someconcern, and I kept him, in closer observation. In a little while hewas at the table again, pouring out another glass of wine. I thoughtit might be for a lady upon whom he was in attendance; but no, thesparkling liquor touched his own lips. When the company returned tothe parlors, the flushed face, swimming eyes, and over-hilariousmanner of my young friend, showed too plainly that he had beendrinking to excess. He was so much excited as to attract theattention of every one, and his condition became the subject ofremark. He was mortified and distressed at the occurrence, anddrawing him from the room, made free to tell him the truth. Heshowed some indignation at first, and intimated that I had insultedhim but I rebuked him sternly, and told him he had better go home. Iwas too much excited to act very wisely. He took me at my word, andleft the house. There was no sleep for my eyes on that night, Mrs.Eldridge. The image of that boy going home to his mother atmidnight, in such a condition, and made so by my hand haunted melike a rebuking spectre; and I resolved never again to set out atable with liquors to a promiscuous company of young and old, and Ihave kept that word of promise. My husband is not willing to have aparty unless there is wine with the refreshments, and I would ratherforego all entertainments than put temptation in the way of any one.Your son's suggestion is admirable. Have the independence to actupon it, and set an example which many will be glad to follow. Don'tfear criticism or remark; don't stop to ask what this one will sayor that one think. The approval of our own consciences is worth farmore than the opinions of men. Is it right? That is the question toask; not How will it appear? or What will people say? There will bea number of parties given to your niece, without doubt; and if you,lead off with coffee instead of wine, all the rest of Fanny'sfriends may follow the good example."When Mr. Eldridge came home at dinner-time, his wife said to him,--"You needn't order any liquors from Snyder.""Why not?" Mr. Eldridge looked at his wife with some surprise."I'm going to have coffee, instead of wine, and brandy," said Mrs.Eldridge, speaking firmly."Nonsense!" You're jesting.""No, I'm in earnest. These liquors are not only expensive, butdangerous things to offer freely in mixed companies. Many boys gettheir first taste for drink at fashionable parties, and manyreformed men have the old fiery thirst revived by a glass of winepoured out for them in social hospitality. I am afraid to have myconscience burdened with the responsibility which this involves.""There is no question as to the injury that is done by this freepouring out of liquors at our fashionable entertainments. I've longenough seen that," said Mr. Eldridge; "but she will be a bold ladywho ventures to offer a cup of coffee in place of a glass of wine.You had better think twice on this subject before you act once.""I've done little else I but think about it for the last two hours,and the more I think about it the more settled my purpose becomes.""But what put this thing into your head?" inquired Mr. Eldridge."You were in full sail for party this morning, liquor and all; thissudden tacking for a new course is a little surprising. I'mpuzzled.""Your son put it into my head," replied Mrs. Eldridge."Henry? Well, that boy does beat all!" Mr. Eldridge did not speakwith disapprobation, but with a tone of pleasure in his voice. "Andso he proposed that we should have coffee instead of wine andbrandy?""Yes.""Bravo for Henry! I like that. But what will people say, my dear? Idon't want to become a laughing stock.""I'd rather have other people laugh at me for doing right," saidMrs. Eldridge, "than to have my conscience blame me for doingwrong.""Must we give the party?" asked Mr. Eldridge, who did not feel muchinclined to brave public opinion."I don't see that we can well avoid doing so. Parties will be given,and as Fanny is our niece, it will look like a slight towards her ifwe hold back. No, she must have a party; and as I am resolved toexclude liquor, we must come in first. Who knows but all the restmay follow our example.""Don't flatter yourself on any such result. We shall stand alone,you may depend upon it."The evening of the party came and a large company assembled at thehouse of Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge. At eleven o'clock they passed to thesupper-room. On this time the thoughts of the host and hostess hadpassed, ever and anon, during the whole evening, and not withoutmany misgivings as to the effect their entertainment would produceon the minds of the company. Mr. Eldridge was particularly nervouson the subject. There were several gentlemen present whom he knew tobe lovers of good wine; gentlemen at whose houses he had often beenentertained, and never without the exhilarating glass. How wouldthey feel? What would they think? What would they say? Thesequestions fairly haunted him; and he regretted, over and over again,that he had yielded to his wife and excluded the liquors.But there was no holding back now; the die was cast, and they muststand to the issue. Mr. Eldridge tried to speak pleasantly to thelady on his arm, as he ascended to the supper-room; but the wordscame heavily from his tongue, for his heart was dying in him. Soonthe company were around the table, and eyes, critical in suchmatters, taking hurried inventories of what it contained. Settingaside the wine and brandy, the entertainment was of the most liberalcharacter, and the whole arrangement extremely elegant. At each endof the table stood a large coffee-urn, surrounded with cups, themeaning of which was not long a mystery to the company. After theterrapin, oysters, salad, and their accompaniments, Mr. Eldridgesaid to a lady, in a half-hesitating voice, as if he were almostashamed to ask the question,--"Will you have a cup of coffee?""If you please," was the smiling answer. "Nothing would suit mebetter.""Delicious!" Mr. Eldridge heard one of the gentlemen, of whom hestood most in dread, say. "This is indeed a treat. I wouldn't givesuch a cup of coffee for the best glass of wine you could bring me.""I am glad you are pleased," Mr. Eldridge could not help remarking,as he turned to the gentleman."You couldn't have pleased me better," was replied.Soon the cups were circling through the room, and every one seemedto enjoy the rich beverage. It was not the ghost of coffee, norcoffee robbed of its delicate aroma; but clear, strong, fragrant,and mellowed by the most delicious cream. Having elected to servecoffee, Mrs. Eldridge was careful that her entertainment should notprove a failure through any lack of excellence in this article. Andit was very far from proving a failure. The first surprise beingover, one and another began to express an opinion on the subject tothe host and hostess."Let me thank you," said a lady, taking the hand of Mrs. Eldridge,and speaking very warmly, "for your courage in making thisinnovation upon a custom of doubtful prudence. I thank you, as amother, who has two sons here to-night."She said no more, but Mrs. Eldridge understood well her wholemeaning."You are a brave man, and I honor you," was the remark of agentleman to Mr. Eldridge. "There will be many, I think, to followyour good example. I should never have had the courage to lead, butI think I shall be brave enough to follow, when it comes my turn toentertain my friends."Henry was standing by his father when this was said listening withrespectful, but deeply gratified attention."My son, sir," said Mr. Eldridge.The gentleman took the boy by the hand, and while he held it, thefather added,--"I must let the honor go to where it really is due. The suggestioncame from him. He is a Cadet of Temperance, and when the party wastalked of, he pleaded so earnestly for the substitution of coffeefor wine and brandy, and used such good reason for the change, thatwe saw only one right course before us, and that we have adopted."The gentleman, on hearing this, shook the lad's hand warmly, andsaid,--"Your father has reason to be proud of you, my brave boy! There isno telling what good may grew out of this thing. Others will followyour father's example, and hundreds of young men be saved from theenticements of the wine cup."With what strong throbs of pleasure did the boy's heart beat whenthese words came to his ears! He had scarcely hoped for success whenhe pleaded briefly, but earnestly, with his mother. Yet he felt thathe must speak, for to his mind, what she proposed doing was a greatevil. Since it had been resolved to banish liquor from theentertainment, he had heard his father and mother speak severaltimes doubtfully as to the result; and more than once his fatherexpressed result that any such "foolish" attempt to run in the faceof people's prejudices had been thought of. Naturally, he had feltanxious about the result; but now that the affair had gone off sotriumphantly, his heart was outgushing with pleasure.The result was as had been predicted. Four parties were given to thebride, and in each case the good example of Mrs. Eldridge wasfollowed. Coffee took the place of wine and brandy, and it was theremark of nearly all, that there had been no pleasant parties duringthe season.So much for what a boy may do, by only a few right words spoken atthe right time, and in the right manner. Henry Eldridge wasthoughtful, modest, and earnest-minded. His attachment to the causeof temperance was not a mere boyish enthusiasm, but the result of aconviction that intemperance was a vice destructive, to both souland body, and one that lay like a curse and a plague-spot onsociety, He could understand how, if the boys rejected, entirely,the cup of confusion, the next, generation of men would be sober;and this had led him to join the Cadets, and do all in his power toget other lads to join also. In drawing other lads into the order,he had been very successful; and now, in a few respectfully uttered,but earnest words, he had checked the progress of intemperance in acircle far beyond the ordinary reach of his influence.Henry Eldridge was a happy boy that night.10 Add  Coffee vs. Brandy to your library.Return to the T.S.

As soon as Mr. Eldridge left the room hisbook fell upon his lap, and looking towards Mrs. Eldridge, he said,in an earnest but respectful manner,--"Don't have any liquor, mother."Mrs s Eldridge looked neither offended nor irritated by thisremonstrance, as she replied,--"I wish it were possible to avoid having liquor, my son; but it isthe custom of society and if we give a party it must be in the wayit is done by other people."This did not satisfy the boy, who had been for some time associatedwith the Cadets of Temperance, and he answered, but with modesty andgreat respect of, manner,--"If other people do wrong, mother--whatthen?""I am not so sure of its being wrong, Henry.""O, but mother," spoke out the boy, quickly, "if it hurts people todrink, it must be wrong to give them liquor. Now I've been thinkinghow much better it would be to have a nice cup of coffee. I am surethat four out of five would like it a great deal better than wine orbrandy. And nobody could possibly receive any harm. Didn't you hearwhat father said about Mr. Lewis? That he had been rather wild? I amsure I shall never forget seeing him stagger in the street once. Isuppose he has reformed. But just think, if the taste should berevived again and at our house, and he should become intoxicated atthis wedding party! O, mother! It makes me feel dreadfully to thinkabout it. And dear Cousin Fanny! What sorrow it would bring to her!""O, dear, Henry! Don't talk in that kind of a way! You make meshudder all over. You're getting too much carried away by thissubject of temperance"And Mrs. Eldridge left the room to look after her domestic duties.But she could not push from her mind certain uneasy thoughts whichher son's suggestions had awakened. During the morning an intimatelady friend came in to whom Mrs. Eldridge spoke of the intendedparty."And would you believe it," she said, "that old-fashioned boy ofmine actually proposed that we should have coffee instead of wineand brandy.""And you're going to adopt the suggestion," replied the lady, herface lighten up with a pleasant smile."It would suit my own views exactly; but then such an innovationupon a common usage as that; is not to be thought of for a moment.""And why not?" asked the lady. "Coffee is safe, while wine andbrandy are always dangerous in promiscuous companies. You can nevertell in what morbid appetite you may excite an unhealthy craving.You may receive into your house a young man with intellect clear,and moral purposes well-balanced, and send him home at midnight, tohis mother, stupid from intoxication! Take your son's advice, myfriend. Exclude the wine and brandy, and give a pleasant cup ofcoffee to your guests instead.""O, dear, no, I can't do that!" said Mrs. Eldridge. "It would lookas if we were too mean to furnish wines and brandy. Besides, myhusband would never consent to it.""Let me give you a little experience of my own. It may help you to aright decision in this case."The lady spoke with some earnestness, and a sober cast of thought inher countenance. "It is now about three years since I gave a largeparty, at which a number of young men were present,--boys I shouldrather say. Among these was the son of an old and very dear friend.He was in his nineteenth year,--a handsome, intelligent, and mostagreeable person--full of life and pleasant humor. At supper time Inoticed him with a glass of champagne in his hand, gayly talkingwith some ladies. In a little while after, my eyes happening to reston him, I saw him holding, a glass of port wine to his lips, whichwas emptied at a single draught. Again passing near him, in order tospeak to a lady, I observed a tumbler in his hand, and knew thecontents to be brandy and water. This caused me to feel someconcern, and I kept him, in closer observation. In a little while hewas at the table again, pouring out another glass of wine. I thoughtit might be for a lady upon whom he was in attendance; but no, thesparkling liquor touched his own lips. When the company returned tothe parlors, the flushed face, swimming eyes, and over-hilariousmanner of my young friend, showed too plainly that he had beendrinking to excess. He was so much excited as to attract theattention of every one, and his condition became the subject ofremark. He was mortified and distressed at the occurrence, anddrawing him from the room, made free to tell him the truth. Heshowed some indignation at first, and intimated that I had insultedhim but I rebuked him sternly, and told him he had better go home. Iwas too much excited to act very wisely. He took me at my word, andleft the house. There was no sleep for my eyes on that night, Mrs.Eldridge. The image of that boy going home to his mother atmidnight, in such a condition, and made so by my hand haunted melike a rebuking spectre; and I resolved never again to set out atable with liquors to a promiscuous company of young and old, and Ihave kept that word of promise. My husband is not willing to have aparty unless there is wine with the refreshments, and I would ratherforego all entertainments than put temptation in the way of any one.Your son's suggestion is admirable. Have the independence to actupon it, and set an example which many will be glad to follow. Don'tfear criticism or remark; don't stop to ask what this one will sayor that one think. The approval of our own consciences is worth farmore than the opinions of men. Is it right? That is the question toask; not How will it appear? or What will people say? There will bea number of parties given to your niece, without doubt; and if you,lead off with coffee instead of wine, all the rest of Fanny'sfriends may follow the good example."When Mr. Eldridge came home at dinner-time, his wife said to him,--"You needn't order any liquors from Snyder.""Why not?" Mr. Eldridge looked at his wife with some surprise."I'm going to have coffee, instead of wine, and brandy," said Mrs.Eldridge, speaking firmly."Nonsense!" You're jesting.""No, I'm in earnest. These liquors are not only expensive, butdangerous things to offer freely in mixed companies. Many boys gettheir first taste for drink at fashionable parties, and manyreformed men have the old fiery thirst revived by a glass of winepoured out for them in social hospitality. I am afraid to have myconscience burdened with the responsibility which this involves.""There is no question as to the injury that is done by this freepouring out of liquors at our fashionable entertainments. I've longenough seen that," said Mr. Eldridge; "but she will be a bold ladywho ventures to offer a cup of coffee in place of a glass of wine.You had better think twice on this subject before you act once.""I've done little else I but think about it for the last two hours,and the more I think about it the more settled my purpose becomes.""But what put this thing into your head?" inquired Mr. Eldridge."You were in full sail for party this morning, liquor and all; thissudden tacking for a new course is a little surprising. I'mpuzzled.""Your son put it into my head," replied Mrs. Eldridge."Henry? Well, that boy does beat all!" Mr. Eldridge did not speakwith disapprobation, but with a tone of pleasure in his voice. "Andso he proposed that we should have coffee instead of wine andbrandy?""Yes.""Bravo for Henry! I like that. But what will people say, my dear? Idon't want to become a laughing stock.""I'd rather have other people laugh at me for doing right," saidMrs. Eldridge, "than to have my conscience blame me for doingwrong.""Must we give the party?" asked Mr. Eldridge, who did not feel muchinclined to brave public opinion."I don't see that we can well avoid doing so. Parties will be given,and as Fanny is our niece, it will look like a slight towards her ifwe hold back. No, she must have a party; and as I am resolved toexclude liquor, we must come in first. Who knows but all the restmay follow our example.""Don't flatter yourself on any such result. We shall stand alone,you may depend upon it."The evening of the party came and a large company assembled at thehouse of Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge. At eleven o'clock they passed to thesupper-room. On this time the thoughts of the host and hostess hadpassed, ever and anon, during the whole evening, and not withoutmany misgivings as to the effect their entertainment would produceon the minds of the company. Mr. Eldridge was particularly nervouson the subject. There were several gentlemen present whom he knew tobe lovers of good wine; gentlemen at whose houses he had often beenentertained, and never without the exhilarating glass. How wouldthey feel? What would they think? What would they say? Thesequestions fairly haunted him; and he regretted, over and over again,that he had yielded to his wife and excluded the liquors.But there was no holding back now; the die was cast, and they muststand to the issue. Mr. Eldridge tried to speak pleasantly to thelady on his arm, as he ascended to the supper-room; but the wordscame heavily from his tongue, for his heart was dying in him. Soonthe company were around the table, and eyes, critical in suchmatters, taking hurried inventories of what it contained. Settingaside the wine and brandy, the entertainment was of the most liberalcharacter, and the whole arrangement extremely elegant. At each endof the table stood a large coffee-urn, surrounded with cups, themeaning of which was not long a mystery to the company. After theterrapin, oysters, salad, and their accompaniments, Mr. Eldridgesaid to a lady, in a half-hesitating voice, as if he were almostashamed to ask the question,--"Will you have a cup of coffee?""If you please," was the smiling answer. "Nothing would suit mebetter.""Delicious!" Mr. Eldridge heard one of the gentlemen, of whom hestood most in dread, say. "This is indeed a treat. I wouldn't givesuch a cup of coffee for the best glass of wine you could bring me.""I am glad you are pleased," Mr. Eldridge could not help remarking,as he turned to the gentleman."You couldn't have pleased me better," was replied.Soon the cups were circling through the room, and every one seemedto enjoy the rich beverage. It was not the ghost of coffee, norcoffee robbed of its delicate aroma; but clear, strong, fragrant,and mellowed by the most delicious cream. Having elected to servecoffee, Mrs. Eldridge was careful that her entertainment should notprove a failure through any lack of excellence in this article. Andit was very far from proving a failure. The first surprise beingover, one and another began to express an opinion on the subject tothe host and hostess."Let me thank you," said a lady, taking the hand of Mrs. Eldridge,and speaking very warmly, "for your courage in making thisinnovation upon a custom of doubtful prudence. I thank you, as amother, who has two sons here to-night."She said no more, but Mrs. Eldridge understood well her wholemeaning."You are a brave man, and I honor you," was the remark of agentleman to Mr. Eldridge. "There will be many, I think, to followyour good example. I should never have had the courage to lead, butI think I shall be brave enough to follow, when it comes my turn toentertain my friends."Henry was standing by his father when this was said listening withrespectful, but deeply gratified attention."My son, sir," said Mr. Eldridge.The gentleman took the boy by the hand, and while he held it, thefather added,--"I must let the honor go to where it really is due. The suggestioncame from him. He is a Cadet of Temperance, and when the party wastalked of, he pleaded so earnestly for the substitution of coffeefor wine and brandy, and used such good reason for the change, thatwe saw only one right course before us, and that we have adopted."The gentleman, on hearing this, shook the lad's hand warmly, andsaid,--"Your father has reason to be proud of you, my brave boy! There isno telling what good may grew out of this thing. Others will followyour father's example, and hundreds of young men be saved from theenticements of the wine cup."With what strong throbs of pleasure did the boy's heart beat whenthese words came to his ears! He had scarcely hoped for success whenhe pleaded briefly, but earnestly, with his mother. Yet he felt thathe must speak, for to his mind, what she proposed doing was a greatevil. Since it had been resolved to banish liquor from theentertainment, he had heard his father and mother speak severaltimes doubtfully as to the result; and more than once his fatherexpressed result that any such "foolish" attempt to run in the faceof people's prejudices had been thought of. Naturally, he had feltanxious about the result; but now that the affair had gone off sotriumphantly, his heart was outgushing with pleasure.The result was as had been predicted. Four parties were given to thebride, and in each case the good example of Mrs. Eldridge wasfollowed. Coffee took the place of wine and brandy, and it was theremark of nearly all, that there had been no pleasant parties duringthe season.So much for what a boy may do, by only a few right words spoken atthe right time, and in the right manner. Henry Eldridge wasthoughtful, modest, and earnest-minded. His attachment to the causeof temperance was not a mere boyish enthusiasm, but the result of aconviction that intemperance was a vice destructive, to both souland body, and one that lay like a curse and a plague-spot onsociety, He could understand how, if the boys rejected, entirely,the cup of confusion, the next, generation of men would be sober;and this had led him to join the Cadets, and do all in his power toget other lads to join also. In drawing other lads into the order,he had been very successful; and now, in a few respectfully uttered,but earnest words, he had checked the progress of intemperance in acircle far beyond the ordinary reach of his influence.Henry Eldridge was a happy boy that night.10 Add  Coffee vs. Brandy to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Common People "As you like about that," replied Mr. Eldridge. "The trouble will beyours.""You have no objections?""O, none in the world. Fanny is a good little girl, and the least wecan do is to pay her this compliment on her marriage. I am notaltogether satisfied about her husband, however; he was rather awild sort of a boy a year or two ago.""I guess he's all right now," remarked Mrs. Eldridge; "and hestrikes me as a very kind-hearted, well-meaning young man. I haveflattered myself that Fanny has done quite well as the average runof girls.""Perhaps so," said Mr. Eldridge, a little thoughtfully."Will you be in the neighborhood of Snyder's?" inquired the lady."I think not. We are very busy just now, and I shall hardly havetime to leave the store to-day. But I can step around thereto-morrow.""To-morrow, or even the next day, will answer," replied Mrs.Eldridge. "You must order the liquors. I will attend to everythingelse.""How many are you going to invite?" inquired Mr. Eldridge."I have not made out a list yet, but it will not fall much short ofseventy or eighty.""Seventy or eighty!" repeated Mr. Eldridge."Let me see. Three dozen of champagne; a dozen of sherry; a dozen ofport; a dozen of hock, and a gallon of brandy,--that will be enoughto put life into them I imagine.""Or death!" Mrs. Eldridge spoke to herself, in an undertone.Her husband, if he noticed the remark, did not reply to it, butsaid, "Good morning," and left the house. A lad about sixteen yearsof age sat in the room during this conversation, with a book in hishand and his eyes on the page before him. He did not once look up ormove; and an observer would have supposed him so much interested inhis book as not to have heard the passing conversation. But he hadlistened to every word.

"Coffee is safe, while wine andbrandy are always dangerous in promiscuous companies. You can nevertell in what morbid appetite you may excite an unhealthy craving.You may receive into your house a young man with intellect clear,and moral purposes well-balanced, and send him home at midnight, tohis mother, stupid from intoxication! Take your son's advice, myfriend. Exclude the wine and brandy, and give a pleasant cup ofcoffee to your guests instead.""O, dear, no, I can't do that!" said Mrs. Eldridge. "It would lookas if we were too mean to furnish wines and brandy. Besides, myhusband would never consent to it.""Let me give you a little experience of my own. It may help you to aright decision in this case."The lady spoke with some earnestness, and a sober cast of thought inher countenance. "It is now about three years since I gave a largeparty, at which a number of young men were present,--boys I shouldrather say. Among these was the son of an old and very dear friend.He was in his nineteenth year,--a handsome, intelligent, and mostagreeable person--full of life and pleasant humor. At supper time Inoticed him with a glass of champagne in his hand, gayly talkingwith some ladies. In a little while after, my eyes happening to reston him, I saw him holding, a glass of port wine to his lips, whichwas emptied at a single draught. Again passing near him, in order tospeak to a lady, I observed a tumbler in his hand, and knew thecontents to be brandy and water. This caused me to feel someconcern, and I kept him, in closer observation. In a little while hewas at the table again, pouring out another glass of wine. I thoughtit might be for a lady upon whom he was in attendance; but no, thesparkling liquor touched his own lips. When the company returned tothe parlors, the flushed face, swimming eyes, and over-hilariousmanner of my young friend, showed too plainly that he had beendrinking to excess. He was so much excited as to attract theattention of every one, and his condition became the subject ofremark. He was mortified and distressed at the occurrence, anddrawing him from the room, made free to tell him the truth. Heshowed some indignation at first, and intimated that I had insultedhim but I rebuked him sternly, and told him he had better go home. Iwas too much excited to act very wisely. He took me at my word, andleft the house. There was no sleep for my eyes on that night, Mrs.Eldridge. The image of that boy going home to his mother atmidnight, in such a condition, and made so by my hand haunted melike a rebuking spectre; and I resolved never again to set out atable with liquors to a promiscuous company of young and old, and Ihave kept that word of promise. My husband is not willing to have aparty unless there is wine with the refreshments, and I would ratherforego all entertainments than put temptation in the way of any one.Your son's suggestion is admirable. Have the independence to actupon it, and set an example which many will be glad to follow. Don'tfear criticism or remark; don't stop to ask what this one will sayor that one think. The approval of our own consciences is worth farmore than the opinions of men. Is it right? That is the question toask; not How will it appear? or What will people say? There will bea number of parties given to your niece, without doubt; and if you,lead off with coffee instead of wine, all the rest of Fanny'sfriends may follow the good example."When Mr. Eldridge came home at dinner-time, his wife said to him,--"You needn't order any liquors from Snyder.""Why not?" Mr. Eldridge looked at his wife with some surprise."I'm going to have coffee, instead of wine, and brandy," said Mrs.Eldridge, speaking firmly."Nonsense!" You're jesting.""No, I'm in earnest. These liquors are not only expensive, butdangerous things to offer freely in mixed companies. Many boys gettheir first taste for drink at fashionable parties, and manyreformed men have the old fiery thirst revived by a glass of winepoured out for them in social hospitality. I am afraid to have myconscience burdened with the responsibility which this involves.""There is no question as to the injury that is done by this freepouring out of liquors at our fashionable entertainments. I've longenough seen that," said Mr. Eldridge; "but she will be a bold ladywho ventures to offer a cup of coffee in place of a glass of wine.You had better think twice on this subject before you act once.""I've done little else I but think about it for the last two hours,and the more I think about it the more settled my purpose becomes.""But what put this thing into your head?" inquired Mr. Eldridge."You were in full sail for party this morning, liquor and all; thissudden tacking for a new course is a little surprising. I'mpuzzled.""Your son put it into my head," replied Mrs. Eldridge."Henry? Well, that boy does beat all!" Mr. Eldridge did not speakwith disapprobation, but with a tone of pleasure in his voice. "Andso he proposed that we should have coffee instead of wine andbrandy?""Yes.""Bravo for Henry! I like that. But what will people say, my dear? Idon't want to become a laughing stock.""I'd rather have other people laugh at me for doing right," saidMrs. Eldridge, "than to have my conscience blame me for doingwrong.""Must we give the party?" asked Mr. Eldridge, who did not feel muchinclined to brave public opinion."I don't see that we can well avoid doing so. Parties will be given,and as Fanny is our niece, it will look like a slight towards her ifwe hold back. No, she must have a party; and as I am resolved toexclude liquor, we must come in first. Who knows but all the restmay follow our example.""Don't flatter yourself on any such result. We shall stand alone,you may depend upon it."The evening of the party came and a large company assembled at thehouse of Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge. At eleven o'clock they passed to thesupper-room. On this time the thoughts of the host and hostess hadpassed, ever and anon, during the whole evening, and not withoutmany misgivings as to the effect their entertainment would produceon the minds of the company. Mr. Eldridge was particularly nervouson the subject. There were several gentlemen present whom he knew tobe lovers of good wine; gentlemen at whose houses he had often beenentertained, and never without the exhilarating glass. How wouldthey feel? What would they think? What would they say? Thesequestions fairly haunted him; and he regretted, over and over again,that he had yielded to his wife and excluded the liquors.But there was no holding back now; the die was cast, and they muststand to the issue. Mr. Eldridge tried to speak pleasantly to thelady on his arm, as he ascended to the supper-room; but the wordscame heavily from his tongue, for his heart was dying in him. Soonthe company were around the table, and eyes, critical in suchmatters, taking hurried inventories of what it contained. Settingaside the wine and brandy, the entertainment was of the most liberalcharacter, and the whole arrangement extremely elegant. At each endof the table stood a large coffee-urn, surrounded with cups, themeaning of which was not long a mystery to the company. After theterrapin, oysters, salad, and their accompaniments, Mr. Eldridgesaid to a lady, in a half-hesitating voice, as if he were almostashamed to ask the question,--"Will you have a cup of coffee?""If you please," was the smiling answer. "Nothing would suit mebetter.""Delicious!" Mr. Eldridge heard one of the gentlemen, of whom hestood most in dread, say. "This is indeed a treat. I wouldn't givesuch a cup of coffee for the best glass of wine you could bring me.""I am glad you are pleased," Mr. Eldridge could not help remarking,as he turned to the gentleman."You couldn't have pleased me better," was replied.Soon the cups were circling through the room, and every one seemedto enjoy the rich beverage. It was not the ghost of coffee, norcoffee robbed of its delicate aroma; but clear, strong, fragrant,and mellowed by the most delicious cream. Having elected to servecoffee, Mrs. Eldridge was careful that her entertainment should notprove a failure through any lack of excellence in this article. Andit was very far from proving a failure. The first surprise beingover, one and another began to express an opinion on the subject tothe host and hostess."Let me thank you," said a lady, taking the hand of Mrs. Eldridge,and speaking very warmly, "for your courage in making thisinnovation upon a custom of doubtful prudence. I thank you, as amother, who has two sons here to-night."She said no more, but Mrs. Eldridge understood well her wholemeaning."You are a brave man, and I honor you," was the remark of agentleman to Mr. Eldridge. "There will be many, I think, to followyour good example. I should never have had the courage to lead, butI think I shall be brave enough to follow, when it comes my turn toentertain my friends."Henry was standing by his father when this was said listening withrespectful, but deeply gratified attention."My son, sir," said Mr. Eldridge.The gentleman took the boy by the hand, and while he held it, thefather added,--"I must let the honor go to where it really is due. The suggestioncame from him. He is a Cadet of Temperance, and when the party wastalked of, he pleaded so earnestly for the substitution of coffeefor wine and brandy, and used such good reason for the change, thatwe saw only one right course before us, and that we have adopted."The gentleman, on hearing this, shook the lad's hand warmly, andsaid,--"Your father has reason to be proud of you, my brave boy! There isno telling what good may grew out of this thing. Others will followyour father's example, and hundreds of young men be saved from theenticements of the wine cup."With what strong throbs of pleasure did the boy's heart beat whenthese words came to his ears! He had scarcely hoped for success whenhe pleaded briefly, but earnestly, with his mother. Yet he felt thathe must speak, for to his mind, what she proposed doing was a greatevil. Since it had been resolved to banish liquor from theentertainment, he had heard his father and mother speak severaltimes doubtfully as to the result; and more than once his fatherexpressed result that any such "foolish" attempt to run in the faceof people's prejudices had been thought of. Naturally, he had feltanxious about the result; but now that the affair had gone off sotriumphantly, his heart was outgushing with pleasure.The result was as had been predicted. Four parties were given to thebride, and in each case the good example of Mrs. Eldridge wasfollowed. Coffee took the place of wine and brandy, and it was theremark of nearly all, that there had been no pleasant parties duringthe season.So much for what a boy may do, by only a few right words spoken atthe right time, and in the right manner. Henry Eldridge wasthoughtful, modest, and earnest-minded. His attachment to the causeof temperance was not a mere boyish enthusiasm, but the result of aconviction that intemperance was a vice destructive, to both souland body, and one that lay like a curse and a plague-spot onsociety, He could understand how, if the boys rejected, entirely,the cup of confusion, the next, generation of men would be sober;and this had led him to join the Cadets, and do all in his power toget other lads to join also. In drawing other lads into the order,he had been very successful; and now, in a few respectfully uttered,but earnest words, he had checked the progress of intemperance in acircle far beyond the ordinary reach of his influence.Henry Eldridge was a happy boy that night.10 Add  Coffee vs. Brandy to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Common People "O, none in the world. Fanny is a good little girl, and the least wecan do is to pay her this compliment on her marriage. I am notaltogether satisfied about her husband, however; he was rather awild sort of a boy a year or two ago.""I guess he's all right now," remarked Mrs. Eldridge; "and hestrikes me as a very kind-hearted, well-meaning young man. I haveflattered myself that Fanny has done quite well as the average runof girls.""Perhaps so," said Mr. Eldridge, a little thoughtfully."Will you be in the neighborhood of Snyder's?" inquired the lady."I think not. We are very busy just now, and I shall hardly havetime to leave the store to-day. But I can step around thereto-morrow.""To-morrow, or even the next day, will answer," replied Mrs.Eldridge. "You must order the liquors. I will attend to everythingelse.""How many are you going to invite?" inquired Mr. Eldridge."I have not made out a list yet, but it will not fall much short ofseventy or eighty.""Seventy or eighty!" repeated Mr. Eldridge."Let me see. Three dozen of champagne; a dozen of sherry; a dozen ofport; a dozen of hock, and a gallon of brandy,--that will be enoughto put life into them I imagine.""Or death!" Mrs. Eldridge spoke to herself, in an undertone.Her husband, if he noticed the remark, did not reply to it, butsaid, "Good morning," and left the house. A lad about sixteen yearsof age sat in the room during this conversation, with a book in hishand and his eyes on the page before him. He did not once look up ormove; and an observer would have supposed him so much interested inhis book as not to have heard the passing conversation. But he hadlistened to every word. As soon as Mr. Eldridge left the room hisbook fell upon his lap, and looking towards Mrs. Eldridge, he said,in an earnest but respectful manner,--"Don't have any liquor, mother."Mrs s Eldridge looked neither offended nor irritated by thisremonstrance, as she replied,--"I wish it were possible to avoid having liquor, my son; but it isthe custom of society and if we give a party it must be in the wayit is done by other people."This did not satisfy the boy, who had been for some time associatedwith the Cadets of Temperance, and he answered, but with modesty andgreat respect of, manner,--"If other people do wrong, mother--whatthen?""I am not so sure of its being wrong, Henry.""O, but mother," spoke out the boy, quickly, "if it hurts people todrink, it must be wrong to give them liquor. Now I've been thinkinghow much better it would be to have a nice cup of coffee. I am surethat four out of five would like it a great deal better than wine orbrandy. And nobody could possibly receive any harm. Didn't you hearwhat father said about Mr. Lewis? That he had been rather wild? I amsure I shall never forget seeing him stagger in the street once. Isuppose he has reformed. But just think, if the taste should berevived again and at our house, and he should become intoxicated atthis wedding party! O, mother! It makes me feel dreadfully to thinkabout it. And dear Cousin Fanny! What sorrow it would bring to her!""O, dear, Henry! Don't talk in that kind of a way! You make meshudder all over.

Heshowed some indignation at first, and intimated that I had insultedhim but I rebuked him sternly, and told him he had better go home. Iwas too much excited to act very wisely. He took me at my word, andleft the house. There was no sleep for my eyes on that night, Mrs.Eldridge. The image of that boy going home to his mother atmidnight, in such a condition, and made so by my hand haunted melike a rebuking spectre; and I resolved never again to set out atable with liquors to a promiscuous company of young and old, and Ihave kept that word of promise. My husband is not willing to have aparty unless there is wine with the refreshments, and I would ratherforego all entertainments than put temptation in the way of any one.Your son's suggestion is admirable. Have the independence to actupon it, and set an example which many will be glad to follow. Don'tfear criticism or remark; don't stop to ask what this one will sayor that one think. The approval of our own consciences is worth farmore than the opinions of men. Is it right? That is the question toask; not How will it appear? or What will people say? There will bea number of parties given to your niece, without doubt; and if you,lead off with coffee instead of wine, all the rest of Fanny'sfriends may follow the good example."When Mr. Eldridge came home at dinner-time, his wife said to him,--"You needn't order any liquors from Snyder.""Why not?" Mr. Eldridge looked at his wife with some surprise."I'm going to have coffee, instead of wine, and brandy," said Mrs.Eldridge, speaking firmly."Nonsense!" You're jesting.""No, I'm in earnest. These liquors are not only expensive, butdangerous things to offer freely in mixed companies. Many boys gettheir first taste for drink at fashionable parties, and manyreformed men have the old fiery thirst revived by a glass of winepoured out for them in social hospitality. I am afraid to have myconscience burdened with the responsibility which this involves.""There is no question as to the injury that is done by this freepouring out of liquors at our fashionable entertainments. I've longenough seen that," said Mr. Eldridge; "but she will be a bold ladywho ventures to offer a cup of coffee in place of a glass of wine.You had better think twice on this subject before you act once.""I've done little else I but think about it for the last two hours,and the more I think about it the more settled my purpose becomes.""But what put this thing into your head?" inquired Mr. Eldridge."You were in full sail for party this morning, liquor and all; thissudden tacking for a new course is a little surprising. I'mpuzzled.""Your son put it into my head," replied Mrs. Eldridge."Henry? Well, that boy does beat all!" Mr. Eldridge did not speakwith disapprobation, but with a tone of pleasure in his voice. "Andso he proposed that we should have coffee instead of wine andbrandy?""Yes.""Bravo for Henry! I like that. But what will people say, my dear? Idon't want to become a laughing stock.""I'd rather have other people laugh at me for doing right," saidMrs. Eldridge, "than to have my conscience blame me for doingwrong.""Must we give the party?" asked Mr. Eldridge, who did not feel muchinclined to brave public opinion."I don't see that we can well avoid doing so. Parties will be given,and as Fanny is our niece, it will look like a slight towards her ifwe hold back. No, she must have a party; and as I am resolved toexclude liquor, we must come in first. Who knows but all the restmay follow our example.""Don't flatter yourself on any such result. We shall stand alone,you may depend upon it."The evening of the party came and a large company assembled at thehouse of Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge. At eleven o'clock they passed to thesupper-room. On this time the thoughts of the host and hostess hadpassed, ever and anon, during the whole evening, and not withoutmany misgivings as to the effect their entertainment would produceon the minds of the company. Mr. Eldridge was particularly nervouson the subject. There were several gentlemen present whom he knew tobe lovers of good wine; gentlemen at whose houses he had often beenentertained, and never without the exhilarating glass. How wouldthey feel? What would they think? What would they say? Thesequestions fairly haunted him; and he regretted, over and over again,that he had yielded to his wife and excluded the liquors.But there was no holding back now; the die was cast, and they muststand to the issue. Mr. Eldridge tried to speak pleasantly to thelady on his arm, as he ascended to the supper-room; but the wordscame heavily from his tongue, for his heart was dying in him. Soonthe company were around the table, and eyes, critical in suchmatters, taking hurried inventories of what it contained. Settingaside the wine and brandy, the entertainment was of the most liberalcharacter, and the whole arrangement extremely elegant. At each endof the table stood a large coffee-urn, surrounded with cups, themeaning of which was not long a mystery to the company. After theterrapin, oysters, salad, and their accompaniments, Mr. Eldridgesaid to a lady, in a half-hesitating voice, as if he were almostashamed to ask the question,--"Will you have a cup of coffee?""If you please," was the smiling answer. "Nothing would suit mebetter.""Delicious!" Mr. Eldridge heard one of the gentlemen, of whom hestood most in dread, say. "This is indeed a treat. I wouldn't givesuch a cup of coffee for the best glass of wine you could bring me.""I am glad you are pleased," Mr. Eldridge could not help remarking,as he turned to the gentleman."You couldn't have pleased me better," was replied.Soon the cups were circling through the room, and every one seemedto enjoy the rich beverage. It was not the ghost of coffee, norcoffee robbed of its delicate aroma; but clear, strong, fragrant,and mellowed by the most delicious cream. Having elected to servecoffee, Mrs. Eldridge was careful that her entertainment should notprove a failure through any lack of excellence in this article. Andit was very far from proving a failure. The first surprise beingover, one and another began to express an opinion on the subject tothe host and hostess."Let me thank you," said a lady, taking the hand of Mrs. Eldridge,and speaking very warmly, "for your courage in making thisinnovation upon a custom of doubtful prudence. I thank you, as amother, who has two sons here to-night."She said no more, but Mrs. Eldridge understood well her wholemeaning."You are a brave man, and I honor you," was the remark of agentleman to Mr. Eldridge. "There will be many, I think, to followyour good example. I should never have had the courage to lead, butI think I shall be brave enough to follow, when it comes my turn toentertain my friends."Henry was standing by his father when this was said listening withrespectful, but deeply gratified attention."My son, sir," said Mr. Eldridge.The gentleman took the boy by the hand, and while he held it, thefather added,--"I must let the honor go to where it really is due. The suggestioncame from him. He is a Cadet of Temperance, and when the party wastalked of, he pleaded so earnestly for the substitution of coffeefor wine and brandy, and used such good reason for the change, thatwe saw only one right course before us, and that we have adopted."The gentleman, on hearing this, shook the lad's hand warmly, andsaid,--"Your father has reason to be proud of you, my brave boy! There isno telling what good may grew out of this thing. Others will followyour father's example, and hundreds of young men be saved from theenticements of the wine cup."With what strong throbs of pleasure did the boy's heart beat whenthese words came to his ears! He had scarcely hoped for success whenhe pleaded briefly, but earnestly, with his mother. Yet he felt thathe must speak, for to his mind, what she proposed doing was a greatevil. Since it had been resolved to banish liquor from theentertainment, he had heard his father and mother speak severaltimes doubtfully as to the result; and more than once his fatherexpressed result that any such "foolish" attempt to run in the faceof people's prejudices had been thought of. Naturally, he had feltanxious about the result; but now that the affair had gone off sotriumphantly, his heart was outgushing with pleasure.The result was as had been predicted. Four parties were given to thebride, and in each case the good example of Mrs. Eldridge wasfollowed. Coffee took the place of wine and brandy, and it was theremark of nearly all, that there had been no pleasant parties duringthe season.So much for what a boy may do, by only a few right words spoken atthe right time, and in the right manner. Henry Eldridge wasthoughtful, modest, and earnest-minded. His attachment to the causeof temperance was not a mere boyish enthusiasm, but the result of aconviction that intemperance was a vice destructive, to both souland body, and one that lay like a curse and a plague-spot onsociety, He could understand how, if the boys rejected, entirely,the cup of confusion, the next, generation of men would be sober;and this had led him to join the Cadets, and do all in his power toget other lads to join also. In drawing other lads into the order,he had been very successful; and now, in a few respectfully uttered,but earnest words, he had checked the progress of intemperance in acircle far beyond the ordinary reach of his influence.Henry Eldridge was a happy boy that night.10 Add  Coffee vs. Brandy to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Common People "Perhaps so," said Mr. Eldridge, a little thoughtfully."Will you be in the neighborhood of Snyder's?" inquired the lady."I think not. We are very busy just now, and I shall hardly havetime to leave the store to-day. But I can step around thereto-morrow.""To-morrow, or even the next day, will answer," replied Mrs.Eldridge. "You must order the liquors. I will attend to everythingelse.""How many are you going to invite?" inquired Mr. Eldridge."I have not made out a list yet, but it will not fall much short ofseventy or eighty.""Seventy or eighty!" repeated Mr. Eldridge."Let me see. Three dozen of champagne; a dozen of sherry; a dozen ofport; a dozen of hock, and a gallon of brandy,--that will be enoughto put life into them I imagine.""Or death!" Mrs. Eldridge spoke to herself, in an undertone.Her husband, if he noticed the remark, did not reply to it, butsaid, "Good morning," and left the house. A lad about sixteen yearsof age sat in the room during this conversation, with a book in hishand and his eyes on the page before him. He did not once look up ormove; and an observer would have supposed him so much interested inhis book as not to have heard the passing conversation. But he hadlistened to every word. As soon as Mr. Eldridge left the room hisbook fell upon his lap, and looking towards Mrs. Eldridge, he said,in an earnest but respectful manner,--"Don't have any liquor, mother."Mrs s Eldridge looked neither offended nor irritated by thisremonstrance, as she replied,--"I wish it were possible to avoid having liquor, my son; but it isthe custom of society and if we give a party it must be in the wayit is done by other people."This did not satisfy the boy, who had been for some time associatedwith the Cadets of Temperance, and he answered, but with modesty andgreat respect of, manner,--"If other people do wrong, mother--whatthen?""I am not so sure of its being wrong, Henry.""O, but mother," spoke out the boy, quickly, "if it hurts people todrink, it must be wrong to give them liquor. Now I've been thinkinghow much better it would be to have a nice cup of coffee. I am surethat four out of five would like it a great deal better than wine orbrandy. And nobody could possibly receive any harm. Didn't you hearwhat father said about Mr. Lewis? That he had been rather wild? I amsure I shall never forget seeing him stagger in the street once. Isuppose he has reformed. But just think, if the taste should berevived again and at our house, and he should become intoxicated atthis wedding party! O, mother! It makes me feel dreadfully to thinkabout it. And dear Cousin Fanny! What sorrow it would bring to her!""O, dear, Henry! Don't talk in that kind of a way! You make meshudder all over. You're getting too much carried away by thissubject of temperance"And Mrs. Eldridge left the room to look after her domestic duties.But she could not push from her mind certain uneasy thoughts whichher son's suggestions had awakened. During the morning an intimatelady friend came in to whom Mrs. Eldridge spoke of the intendedparty."And would you believe it," she said, "that old-fashioned boy ofmine actually proposed that we should have coffee instead of wineand brandy.""And you're going to adopt the suggestion," replied the lady, herface lighten up with a pleasant smile."It would suit my own views exactly; but then such an innovationupon a common usage as that; is not to be thought of for a moment.""And why not?" asked the lady. "Coffee is safe, while wine andbrandy are always dangerous in promiscuous companies. You can nevertell in what morbid appetite you may excite an unhealthy craving.You may receive into your house a young man with intellect clear,and moral purposes well-balanced, and send him home at midnight, tohis mother, stupid from intoxication! Take your son's advice, myfriend. Exclude the wine and brandy, and give a pleasant cup ofcoffee to your guests instead.""O, dear, no, I can't do that!" said Mrs. Eldridge. "It would lookas if we were too mean to furnish wines and brandy. Besides, myhusband would never consent to it.""Let me give you a little experience of my own. It may help you to aright decision in this case."The lady spoke with some earnestness, and a sober cast of thought inher countenance. "It is now about three years since I gave a largeparty, at which a number of young men were present,--boys I shouldrather say. Among these was the son of an old and very dear friend.He was in his nineteenth year,--a handsome, intelligent, and mostagreeable person--full of life and pleasant humor. At supper time Inoticed him with a glass of champagne in his hand, gayly talkingwith some ladies. In a little while after, my eyes happening to reston him, I saw him holding, a glass of port wine to his lips, whichwas emptied at a single draught. Again passing near him, in order tospeak to a lady, I observed a tumbler in his hand, and knew thecontents to be brandy and water. This caused me to feel someconcern, and I kept him, in closer observation. In a little while hewas at the table again, pouring out another glass of wine. I thoughtit might be for a lady upon whom he was in attendance; but no, thesparkling liquor touched his own lips. When the company returned tothe parlors, the flushed face, swimming eyes, and over-hilariousmanner of my young friend, showed too plainly that he had beendrinking to excess. He was so much excited as to attract theattention of every one, and his condition became the subject ofremark. He was mortified and distressed at the occurrence, anddrawing him from the room, made free to tell him the truth.

Parties will be given,and as Fanny is our niece, it will look like a slight towards her ifwe hold back. No, she must have a party; and as I am resolved toexclude liquor, we must come in first. Who knows but all the restmay follow our example.""Don't flatter yourself on any such result. We shall stand alone,you may depend upon it."The evening of the party came and a large company assembled at thehouse of Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge. At eleven o'clock they passed to thesupper-room. On this time the thoughts of the host and hostess hadpassed, ever and anon, during the whole evening, and not withoutmany misgivings as to the effect their entertainment would produceon the minds of the company. Mr. Eldridge was particularly nervouson the subject. There were several gentlemen present whom he knew tobe lovers of good wine; gentlemen at whose houses he had often beenentertained, and never without the exhilarating glass. How wouldthey feel? What would they think? What would they say? Thesequestions fairly haunted him; and he regretted, over and over again,that he had yielded to his wife and excluded the liquors.But there was no holding back now; the die was cast, and they muststand to the issue. Mr. Eldridge tried to speak pleasantly to thelady on his arm, as he ascended to the supper-room; but the wordscame heavily from his tongue, for his heart was dying in him. Soonthe company were around the table, and eyes, critical in suchmatters, taking hurried inventories of what it contained. Settingaside the wine and brandy, the entertainment was of the most liberalcharacter, and the whole arrangement extremely elegant. At each endof the table stood a large coffee-urn, surrounded with cups, themeaning of which was not long a mystery to the company. After theterrapin, oysters, salad, and their accompaniments, Mr. Eldridgesaid to a lady, in a half-hesitating voice, as if he were almostashamed to ask the question,--"Will you have a cup of coffee?""If you please," was the smiling answer. "Nothing would suit mebetter.""Delicious!" Mr. Eldridge heard one of the gentlemen, of whom hestood most in dread, say. "This is indeed a treat. I wouldn't givesuch a cup of coffee for the best glass of wine you could bring me.""I am glad you are pleased," Mr. Eldridge could not help remarking,as he turned to the gentleman."You couldn't have pleased me better," was replied.Soon the cups were circling through the room, and every one seemedto enjoy the rich beverage. It was not the ghost of coffee, norcoffee robbed of its delicate aroma; but clear, strong, fragrant,and mellowed by the most delicious cream. Having elected to servecoffee, Mrs. Eldridge was careful that her entertainment should notprove a failure through any lack of excellence in this article. Andit was very far from proving a failure. The first surprise beingover, one and another began to express an opinion on the subject tothe host and hostess."Let me thank you," said a lady, taking the hand of Mrs. Eldridge,and speaking very warmly, "for your courage in making thisinnovation upon a custom of doubtful prudence. I thank you, as amother, who has two sons here to-night."She said no more, but Mrs. Eldridge understood well her wholemeaning."You are a brave man, and I honor you," was the remark of agentleman to Mr. Eldridge. "There will be many, I think, to followyour good example. I should never have had the courage to lead, butI think I shall be brave enough to follow, when it comes my turn toentertain my friends."Henry was standing by his father when this was said listening withrespectful, but deeply gratified attention."My son, sir," said Mr. Eldridge.The gentleman took the boy by the hand, and while he held it, thefather added,--"I must let the honor go to where it really is due. The suggestioncame from him. He is a Cadet of Temperance, and when the party wastalked of, he pleaded so earnestly for the substitution of coffeefor wine and brandy, and used such good reason for the change, thatwe saw only one right course before us, and that we have adopted."The gentleman, on hearing this, shook the lad's hand warmly, andsaid,--"Your father has reason to be proud of you, my brave boy! There isno telling what good may grew out of this thing. Others will followyour father's example, and hundreds of young men be saved from theenticements of the wine cup."With what strong throbs of pleasure did the boy's heart beat whenthese words came to his ears! He had scarcely hoped for success whenhe pleaded briefly, but earnestly, with his mother. Yet he felt thathe must speak, for to his mind, what she proposed doing was a greatevil. Since it had been resolved to banish liquor from theentertainment, he had heard his father and mother speak severaltimes doubtfully as to the result; and more than once his fatherexpressed result that any such "foolish" attempt to run in the faceof people's prejudices had been thought of. Naturally, he had feltanxious about the result; but now that the affair had gone off sotriumphantly, his heart was outgushing with pleasure.The result was as had been predicted. Four parties were given to thebride, and in each case the good example of Mrs. Eldridge wasfollowed. Coffee took the place of wine and brandy, and it was theremark of nearly all, that there had been no pleasant parties duringthe season.So much for what a boy may do, by only a few right words spoken atthe right time, and in the right manner. Henry Eldridge wasthoughtful, modest, and earnest-minded. His attachment to the causeof temperance was not a mere boyish enthusiasm, but the result of aconviction that intemperance was a vice destructive, to both souland body, and one that lay like a curse and a plague-spot onsociety, He could understand how, if the boys rejected, entirely,the cup of confusion, the next, generation of men would be sober;and this had led him to join the Cadets, and do all in his power toget other lads to join also. In drawing other lads into the order,he had been very successful; and now, in a few respectfully uttered,but earnest words, he had checked the progress of intemperance in acircle far beyond the ordinary reach of his influence.Henry Eldridge was a happy boy that night.10 Add  Coffee vs. Brandy to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Common People "I think not. We are very busy just now, and I shall hardly havetime to leave the store to-day. But I can step around thereto-morrow.""To-morrow, or even the next day, will answer," replied Mrs.Eldridge. "You must order the liquors. I will attend to everythingelse.""How many are you going to invite?" inquired Mr. Eldridge."I have not made out a list yet, but it will not fall much short ofseventy or eighty.""Seventy or eighty!" repeated Mr. Eldridge."Let me see. Three dozen of champagne; a dozen of sherry; a dozen ofport; a dozen of hock, and a gallon of brandy,--that will be enoughto put life into them I imagine.""Or death!" Mrs. Eldridge spoke to herself, in an undertone.Her husband, if he noticed the remark, did not reply to it, butsaid, "Good morning," and left the house. A lad about sixteen yearsof age sat in the room during this conversation, with a book in hishand and his eyes on the page before him. He did not once look up ormove; and an observer would have supposed him so much interested inhis book as not to have heard the passing conversation. But he hadlistened to every word. As soon as Mr. Eldridge left the room hisbook fell upon his lap, and looking towards Mrs. Eldridge, he said,in an earnest but respectful manner,--"Don't have any liquor, mother."Mrs s Eldridge looked neither offended nor irritated by thisremonstrance, as she replied,--"I wish it were possible to avoid having liquor, my son; but it isthe custom of society and if we give a party it must be in the wayit is done by other people."This did not satisfy the boy, who had been for some time associatedwith the Cadets of Temperance, and he answered, but with modesty andgreat respect of, manner,--"If other people do wrong, mother--whatthen?""I am not so sure of its being wrong, Henry.""O, but mother," spoke out the boy, quickly, "if it hurts people todrink, it must be wrong to give them liquor. Now I've been thinkinghow much better it would be to have a nice cup of coffee. I am surethat four out of five would like it a great deal better than wine orbrandy. And nobody could possibly receive any harm. Didn't you hearwhat father said about Mr. Lewis? That he had been rather wild? I amsure I shall never forget seeing him stagger in the street once. Isuppose he has reformed. But just think, if the taste should berevived again and at our house, and he should become intoxicated atthis wedding party! O, mother! It makes me feel dreadfully to thinkabout it. And dear Cousin Fanny! What sorrow it would bring to her!""O, dear, Henry! Don't talk in that kind of a way! You make meshudder all over. You're getting too much carried away by thissubject of temperance"And Mrs. Eldridge left the room to look after her domestic duties.But she could not push from her mind certain uneasy thoughts whichher son's suggestions had awakened. During the morning an intimatelady friend came in to whom Mrs. Eldridge spoke of the intendedparty."And would you believe it," she said, "that old-fashioned boy ofmine actually proposed that we should have coffee instead of wineand brandy.""And you're going to adopt the suggestion," replied the lady, herface lighten up with a pleasant smile."It would suit my own views exactly; but then such an innovationupon a common usage as that; is not to be thought of for a moment.""And why not?" asked the lady. "Coffee is safe, while wine andbrandy are always dangerous in promiscuous companies. You can nevertell in what morbid appetite you may excite an unhealthy craving.You may receive into your house a young man with intellect clear,and moral purposes well-balanced, and send him home at midnight, tohis mother, stupid from intoxication! Take your son's advice, myfriend. Exclude the wine and brandy, and give a pleasant cup ofcoffee to your guests instead.""O, dear, no, I can't do that!" said Mrs. Eldridge. "It would lookas if we were too mean to furnish wines and brandy. Besides, myhusband would never consent to it.""Let me give you a little experience of my own. It may help you to aright decision in this case."The lady spoke with some earnestness, and a sober cast of thought inher countenance. "It is now about three years since I gave a largeparty, at which a number of young men were present,--boys I shouldrather say. Among these was the son of an old and very dear friend.He was in his nineteenth year,--a handsome, intelligent, and mostagreeable person--full of life and pleasant humor. At supper time Inoticed him with a glass of champagne in his hand, gayly talkingwith some ladies. In a little while after, my eyes happening to reston him, I saw him holding, a glass of port wine to his lips, whichwas emptied at a single draught. Again passing near him, in order tospeak to a lady, I observed a tumbler in his hand, and knew thecontents to be brandy and water. This caused me to feel someconcern, and I kept him, in closer observation. In a little while hewas at the table again, pouring out another glass of wine. I thoughtit might be for a lady upon whom he was in attendance; but no, thesparkling liquor touched his own lips. When the company returned tothe parlors, the flushed face, swimming eyes, and over-hilariousmanner of my young friend, showed too plainly that he had beendrinking to excess. He was so much excited as to attract theattention of every one, and his condition became the subject ofremark. He was mortified and distressed at the occurrence, anddrawing him from the room, made free to tell him the truth. Heshowed some indignation at first, and intimated that I had insultedhim but I rebuked him sternly, and told him he had better go home. Iwas too much excited to act very wisely. He took me at my word, andleft the house. There was no sleep for my eyes on that night, Mrs.Eldridge. The image of that boy going home to his mother atmidnight, in such a condition, and made so by my hand haunted melike a rebuking spectre; and I resolved never again to set out atable with liquors to a promiscuous company of young and old, and Ihave kept that word of promise. My husband is not willing to have aparty unless there is wine with the refreshments, and I would ratherforego all entertainments than put temptation in the way of any one.Your son's suggestion is admirable. Have the independence to actupon it, and set an example which many will be glad to follow. Don'tfear criticism or remark; don't stop to ask what this one will sayor that one think. The approval of our own consciences is worth farmore than the opinions of men. Is it right? That is the question toask; not How will it appear? or What will people say? There will bea number of parties given to your niece, without doubt; and if you,lead off with coffee instead of wine, all the rest of Fanny'sfriends may follow the good example."When Mr. Eldridge came home at dinner-time, his wife said to him,--"You needn't order any liquors from Snyder.""Why not?" Mr. Eldridge looked at his wife with some surprise."I'm going to have coffee, instead of wine, and brandy," said Mrs.Eldridge, speaking firmly."Nonsense!" You're jesting.""No, I'm in earnest. These liquors are not only expensive, butdangerous things to offer freely in mixed companies. Many boys gettheir first taste for drink at fashionable parties, and manyreformed men have the old fiery thirst revived by a glass of winepoured out for them in social hospitality. I am afraid to have myconscience burdened with the responsibility which this involves.""There is no question as to the injury that is done by this freepouring out of liquors at our fashionable entertainments. I've longenough seen that," said Mr. Eldridge; "but she will be a bold ladywho ventures to offer a cup of coffee in place of a glass of wine.You had better think twice on this subject before you act once.""I've done little else I but think about it for the last two hours,and the more I think about it the more settled my purpose becomes.""But what put this thing into your head?" inquired Mr. Eldridge."You were in full sail for party this morning, liquor and all; thissudden tacking for a new course is a little surprising. I'mpuzzled.""Your son put it into my head," replied Mrs. Eldridge."Henry? Well, that boy does beat all!" Mr. Eldridge did not speakwith disapprobation, but with a tone of pleasure in his voice. "Andso he proposed that we should have coffee instead of wine andbrandy?""Yes.""Bravo for Henry! I like that. But what will people say, my dear? Idon't want to become a laughing stock.""I'd rather have other people laugh at me for doing right," saidMrs. Eldridge, "than to have my conscience blame me for doingwrong.""Must we give the party?" asked Mr. Eldridge, who did not feel muchinclined to brave public opinion."I don't see that we can well avoid doing so.

I should never have had the courage to lead, butI think I shall be brave enough to follow, when it comes my turn toentertain my friends."Henry was standing by his father when this was said listening withrespectful, but deeply gratified attention."My son, sir," said Mr. Eldridge.The gentleman took the boy by the hand, and while he held it, thefather added,--"I must let the honor go to where it really is due. The suggestioncame from him. He is a Cadet of Temperance, and when the party wastalked of, he pleaded so earnestly for the substitution of coffeefor wine and brandy, and used such good reason for the change, thatwe saw only one right course before us, and that we have adopted."The gentleman, on hearing this, shook the lad's hand warmly, andsaid,--"Your father has reason to be proud of you, my brave boy! There isno telling what good may grew out of this thing. Others will followyour father's example, and hundreds of young men be saved from theenticements of the wine cup."With what strong throbs of pleasure did the boy's heart beat whenthese words came to his ears! He had scarcely hoped for success whenhe pleaded briefly, but earnestly, with his mother. Yet he felt thathe must speak, for to his mind, what she proposed doing was a greatevil. Since it had been resolved to banish liquor from theentertainment, he had heard his father and mother speak severaltimes doubtfully as to the result; and more than once his fatherexpressed result that any such "foolish" attempt to run in the faceof people's prejudices had been thought of. Naturally, he had feltanxious about the result; but now that the affair had gone off sotriumphantly, his heart was outgushing with pleasure.The result was as had been predicted. Four parties were given to thebride, and in each case the good example of Mrs. Eldridge wasfollowed. Coffee took the place of wine and brandy, and it was theremark of nearly all, that there had been no pleasant parties duringthe season.So much for what a boy may do, by only a few right words spoken atthe right time, and in the right manner. Henry Eldridge wasthoughtful, modest, and earnest-minded. His attachment to the causeof temperance was not a mere boyish enthusiasm, but the result of aconviction that intemperance was a vice destructive, to both souland body, and one that lay like a curse and a plague-spot onsociety, He could understand how, if the boys rejected, entirely,the cup of confusion, the next, generation of men would be sober;and this had led him to join the Cadets, and do all in his power toget other lads to join also. In drawing other lads into the order,he had been very successful; and now, in a few respectfully uttered,but earnest words, he had checked the progress of intemperance in acircle far beyond the ordinary reach of his influence.Henry Eldridge was a happy boy that night.10 Add  Coffee vs. Brandy to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Common People "How many are you going to invite?" inquired Mr. Eldridge."I have not made out a list yet, but it will not fall much short ofseventy or eighty.""Seventy or eighty!" repeated Mr. Eldridge."Let me see. Three dozen of champagne; a dozen of sherry; a dozen ofport; a dozen of hock, and a gallon of brandy,--that will be enoughto put life into them I imagine.""Or death!" Mrs. Eldridge spoke to herself, in an undertone.Her husband, if he noticed the remark, did not reply to it, butsaid, "Good morning," and left the house. A lad about sixteen yearsof age sat in the room during this conversation, with a book in hishand and his eyes on the page before him. He did not once look up ormove; and an observer would have supposed him so much interested inhis book as not to have heard the passing conversation. But he hadlistened to every word. As soon as Mr. Eldridge left the room hisbook fell upon his lap, and looking towards Mrs. Eldridge, he said,in an earnest but respectful manner,--"Don't have any liquor, mother."Mrs s Eldridge looked neither offended nor irritated by thisremonstrance, as she replied,--"I wish it were possible to avoid having liquor, my son; but it isthe custom of society and if we give a party it must be in the wayit is done by other people."This did not satisfy the boy, who had been for some time associatedwith the Cadets of Temperance, and he answered, but with modesty andgreat respect of, manner,--"If other people do wrong, mother--whatthen?""I am not so sure of its being wrong, Henry.""O, but mother," spoke out the boy, quickly, "if it hurts people todrink, it must be wrong to give them liquor. Now I've been thinkinghow much better it would be to have a nice cup of coffee. I am surethat four out of five would like it a great deal better than wine orbrandy. And nobody could possibly receive any harm. Didn't you hearwhat father said about Mr. Lewis? That he had been rather wild? I amsure I shall never forget seeing him stagger in the street once. Isuppose he has reformed. But just think, if the taste should berevived again and at our house, and he should become intoxicated atthis wedding party! O, mother! It makes me feel dreadfully to thinkabout it. And dear Cousin Fanny! What sorrow it would bring to her!""O, dear, Henry! Don't talk in that kind of a way! You make meshudder all over. You're getting too much carried away by thissubject of temperance"And Mrs. Eldridge left the room to look after her domestic duties.But she could not push from her mind certain uneasy thoughts whichher son's suggestions had awakened. During the morning an intimatelady friend came in to whom Mrs. Eldridge spoke of the intendedparty."And would you believe it," she said, "that old-fashioned boy ofmine actually proposed that we should have coffee instead of wineand brandy.""And you're going to adopt the suggestion," replied the lady, herface lighten up with a pleasant smile."It would suit my own views exactly; but then such an innovationupon a common usage as that; is not to be thought of for a moment.""And why not?" asked the lady. "Coffee is safe, while wine andbrandy are always dangerous in promiscuous companies. You can nevertell in what morbid appetite you may excite an unhealthy craving.You may receive into your house a young man with intellect clear,and moral purposes well-balanced, and send him home at midnight, tohis mother, stupid from intoxication! Take your son's advice, myfriend. Exclude the wine and brandy, and give a pleasant cup ofcoffee to your guests instead.""O, dear, no, I can't do that!" said Mrs. Eldridge. "It would lookas if we were too mean to furnish wines and brandy. Besides, myhusband would never consent to it.""Let me give you a little experience of my own. It may help you to aright decision in this case."The lady spoke with some earnestness, and a sober cast of thought inher countenance. "It is now about three years since I gave a largeparty, at which a number of young men were present,--boys I shouldrather say. Among these was the son of an old and very dear friend.He was in his nineteenth year,--a handsome, intelligent, and mostagreeable person--full of life and pleasant humor. At supper time Inoticed him with a glass of champagne in his hand, gayly talkingwith some ladies. In a little while after, my eyes happening to reston him, I saw him holding, a glass of port wine to his lips, whichwas emptied at a single draught. Again passing near him, in order tospeak to a lady, I observed a tumbler in his hand, and knew thecontents to be brandy and water. This caused me to feel someconcern, and I kept him, in closer observation. In a little while hewas at the table again, pouring out another glass of wine. I thoughtit might be for a lady upon whom he was in attendance; but no, thesparkling liquor touched his own lips. When the company returned tothe parlors, the flushed face, swimming eyes, and over-hilariousmanner of my young friend, showed too plainly that he had beendrinking to excess. He was so much excited as to attract theattention of every one, and his condition became the subject ofremark. He was mortified and distressed at the occurrence, anddrawing him from the room, made free to tell him the truth. Heshowed some indignation at first, and intimated that I had insultedhim but I rebuked him sternly, and told him he had better go home. Iwas too much excited to act very wisely. He took me at my word, andleft the house. There was no sleep for my eyes on that night, Mrs.Eldridge. The image of that boy going home to his mother atmidnight, in such a condition, and made so by my hand haunted melike a rebuking spectre; and I resolved never again to set out atable with liquors to a promiscuous company of young and old, and Ihave kept that word of promise. My husband is not willing to have aparty unless there is wine with the refreshments, and I would ratherforego all entertainments than put temptation in the way of any one.Your son's suggestion is admirable. Have the independence to actupon it, and set an example which many will be glad to follow. Don'tfear criticism or remark; don't stop to ask what this one will sayor that one think. The approval of our own consciences is worth farmore than the opinions of men. Is it right? That is the question toask; not How will it appear? or What will people say? There will bea number of parties given to your niece, without doubt; and if you,lead off with coffee instead of wine, all the rest of Fanny'sfriends may follow the good example."When Mr. Eldridge came home at dinner-time, his wife said to him,--"You needn't order any liquors from Snyder.""Why not?" Mr. Eldridge looked at his wife with some surprise."I'm going to have coffee, instead of wine, and brandy," said Mrs.Eldridge, speaking firmly."Nonsense!" You're jesting.""No, I'm in earnest. These liquors are not only expensive, butdangerous things to offer freely in mixed companies. Many boys gettheir first taste for drink at fashionable parties, and manyreformed men have the old fiery thirst revived by a glass of winepoured out for them in social hospitality. I am afraid to have myconscience burdened with the responsibility which this involves.""There is no question as to the injury that is done by this freepouring out of liquors at our fashionable entertainments. I've longenough seen that," said Mr. Eldridge; "but she will be a bold ladywho ventures to offer a cup of coffee in place of a glass of wine.You had better think twice on this subject before you act once.""I've done little else I but think about it for the last two hours,and the more I think about it the more settled my purpose becomes.""But what put this thing into your head?" inquired Mr. Eldridge."You were in full sail for party this morning, liquor and all; thissudden tacking for a new course is a little surprising. I'mpuzzled.""Your son put it into my head," replied Mrs. Eldridge."Henry? Well, that boy does beat all!" Mr. Eldridge did not speakwith disapprobation, but with a tone of pleasure in his voice. "Andso he proposed that we should have coffee instead of wine andbrandy?""Yes.""Bravo for Henry! I like that. But what will people say, my dear? Idon't want to become a laughing stock.""I'd rather have other people laugh at me for doing right," saidMrs. Eldridge, "than to have my conscience blame me for doingwrong.""Must we give the party?" asked Mr. Eldridge, who did not feel muchinclined to brave public opinion."I don't see that we can well avoid doing so. Parties will be given,and as Fanny is our niece, it will look like a slight towards her ifwe hold back. No, she must have a party; and as I am resolved toexclude liquor, we must come in first. Who knows but all the restmay follow our example.""Don't flatter yourself on any such result. We shall stand alone,you may depend upon it."The evening of the party came and a large company assembled at thehouse of Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge. At eleven o'clock they passed to thesupper-room. On this time the thoughts of the host and hostess hadpassed, ever and anon, during the whole evening, and not withoutmany misgivings as to the effect their entertainment would produceon the minds of the company. Mr. Eldridge was particularly nervouson the subject. There were several gentlemen present whom he knew tobe lovers of good wine; gentlemen at whose houses he had often beenentertained, and never without the exhilarating glass. How wouldthey feel? What would they think? What would they say? Thesequestions fairly haunted him; and he regretted, over and over again,that he had yielded to his wife and excluded the liquors.But there was no holding back now; the die was cast, and they muststand to the issue. Mr. Eldridge tried to speak pleasantly to thelady on his arm, as he ascended to the supper-room; but the wordscame heavily from his tongue, for his heart was dying in him. Soonthe company were around the table, and eyes, critical in suchmatters, taking hurried inventories of what it contained. Settingaside the wine and brandy, the entertainment was of the most liberalcharacter, and the whole arrangement extremely elegant. At each endof the table stood a large coffee-urn, surrounded with cups, themeaning of which was not long a mystery to the company. After theterrapin, oysters, salad, and their accompaniments, Mr. Eldridgesaid to a lady, in a half-hesitating voice, as if he were almostashamed to ask the question,--"Will you have a cup of coffee?""If you please," was the smiling answer. "Nothing would suit mebetter.""Delicious!" Mr. Eldridge heard one of the gentlemen, of whom hestood most in dread, say. "This is indeed a treat. I wouldn't givesuch a cup of coffee for the best glass of wine you could bring me.""I am glad you are pleased," Mr. Eldridge could not help remarking,as he turned to the gentleman."You couldn't have pleased me better," was replied.Soon the cups were circling through the room, and every one seemedto enjoy the rich beverage. It was not the ghost of coffee, norcoffee robbed of its delicate aroma; but clear, strong, fragrant,and mellowed by the most delicious cream. Having elected to servecoffee, Mrs. Eldridge was careful that her entertainment should notprove a failure through any lack of excellence in this article. Andit was very far from proving a failure. The first surprise beingover, one and another began to express an opinion on the subject tothe host and hostess."Let me thank you," said a lady, taking the hand of Mrs. Eldridge,and speaking very warmly, "for your courage in making thisinnovation upon a custom of doubtful prudence. I thank you, as amother, who has two sons here to-night."She said no more, but Mrs. Eldridge understood well her wholemeaning."You are a brave man, and I honor you," was the remark of agentleman to Mr. Eldridge. "There will be many, I think, to followyour good example.

As soon as Mr. Eldridge left the room hisbook fell upon his lap, and looking towards Mrs. Eldridge, he said,in an earnest but respectful manner,--"Don't have any liquor, mother."Mrs s Eldridge looked neither offended nor irritated by thisremonstrance, as she replied,--"I wish it were possible to avoid having liquor, my son; but it isthe custom of society and if we give a party it must be in the wayit is done by other people."This did not satisfy the boy, who had been for some time associatedwith the Cadets of Temperance, and he answered, but with modesty andgreat respect of, manner,--"If other people do wrong, mother--whatthen?""I am not so sure of its being wrong, Henry.""O, but mother," spoke out the boy, quickly, "if it hurts people todrink, it must be wrong to give them liquor. Now I've been thinkinghow much better it would be to have a nice cup of coffee. I am surethat four out of five would like it a great deal better than wine orbrandy. And nobody could possibly receive any harm. Didn't you hearwhat father said about Mr. Lewis? That he had been rather wild? I amsure I shall never forget seeing him stagger in the street once. Isuppose he has reformed. But just think, if the taste should berevived again and at our house, and he should become intoxicated atthis wedding party! O, mother! It makes me feel dreadfully to thinkabout it. And dear Cousin Fanny! What sorrow it would bring to her!""O, dear, Henry! Don't talk in that kind of a way! You make meshudder all over. You're getting too much carried away by thissubject of temperance"And Mrs. Eldridge left the room to look after her domestic duties.But she could not push from her mind certain uneasy thoughts whichher son's suggestions had awakened. During the morning an intimatelady friend came in to whom Mrs. Eldridge spoke of the intendedparty."And would you believe it," she said, "that old-fashioned boy ofmine actually proposed that we should have coffee instead of wineand brandy.""And you're going to adopt the suggestion," replied the lady, herface lighten up with a pleasant smile."It would suit my own views exactly; but then such an innovationupon a common usage as that; is not to be thought of for a moment.""And why not?" asked the lady. "Coffee is safe, while wine andbrandy are always dangerous in promiscuous companies. You can nevertell in what morbid appetite you may excite an unhealthy craving.You may receive into your house a young man with intellect clear,and moral purposes well-balanced, and send him home at midnight, tohis mother, stupid from intoxication! Take your son's advice, myfriend. Exclude the wine and brandy, and give a pleasant cup ofcoffee to your guests instead.""O, dear, no, I can't do that!" said Mrs. Eldridge. "It would lookas if we were too mean to furnish wines and brandy. Besides, myhusband would never consent to it.""Let me give you a little experience of my own. It may help you to aright decision in this case."The lady spoke with some earnestness, and a sober cast of thought inher countenance. "It is now about three years since I gave a largeparty, at which a number of young men were present,--boys I shouldrather say. Among these was the son of an old and very dear friend.He was in his nineteenth year,--a handsome, intelligent, and mostagreeable person--full of life and pleasant humor. At supper time Inoticed him with a glass of champagne in his hand, gayly talkingwith some ladies. In a little while after, my eyes happening to reston him, I saw him holding, a glass of port wine to his lips, whichwas emptied at a single draught. Again passing near him, in order tospeak to a lady, I observed a tumbler in his hand, and knew thecontents to be brandy and water. This caused me to feel someconcern, and I kept him, in closer observation. In a little while hewas at the table again, pouring out another glass of wine. I thoughtit might be for a lady upon whom he was in attendance; but no, thesparkling liquor touched his own lips. When the company returned tothe parlors, the flushed face, swimming eyes, and over-hilariousmanner of my young friend, showed too plainly that he had beendrinking to excess. He was so much excited as to attract theattention of every one, and his condition became the subject ofremark. He was mortified and distressed at the occurrence, anddrawing him from the room, made free to tell him the truth. Heshowed some indignation at first, and intimated that I had insultedhim but I rebuked him sternly, and told him he had better go home. Iwas too much excited to act very wisely. He took me at my word, andleft the house. There was no sleep for my eyes on that night, Mrs.Eldridge. The image of that boy going home to his mother atmidnight, in such a condition, and made so by my hand haunted melike a rebuking spectre; and I resolved never again to set out atable with liquors to a promiscuous company of young and old, and Ihave kept that word of promise. My husband is not willing to have aparty unless there is wine with the refreshments, and I would ratherforego all entertainments than put temptation in the way of any one.Your son's suggestion is admirable. Have the independence to actupon it, and set an example which many will be glad to follow. Don'tfear criticism or remark; don't stop to ask what this one will sayor that one think. The approval of our own consciences is worth farmore than the opinions of men. Is it right? That is the question toask; not How will it appear? or What will people say? There will bea number of parties given to your niece, without doubt; and if you,lead off with coffee instead of wine, all the rest of Fanny'sfriends may follow the good example."When Mr. Eldridge came home at dinner-time, his wife said to him,--"You needn't order any liquors from Snyder.""Why not?" Mr. Eldridge looked at his wife with some surprise."I'm going to have coffee, instead of wine, and brandy," said Mrs.Eldridge, speaking firmly."Nonsense!" You're jesting.""No, I'm in earnest. These liquors are not only expensive, butdangerous things to offer freely in mixed companies. Many boys gettheir first taste for drink at fashionable parties, and manyreformed men have the old fiery thirst revived by a glass of winepoured out for them in social hospitality. I am afraid to have myconscience burdened with the responsibility which this involves.""There is no question as to the injury that is done by this freepouring out of liquors at our fashionable entertainments. I've longenough seen that," said Mr. Eldridge; "but she will be a bold ladywho ventures to offer a cup of coffee in place of a glass of wine.You had better think twice on this subject before you act once.""I've done little else I but think about it for the last two hours,and the more I think about it the more settled my purpose becomes.""But what put this thing into your head?" inquired Mr. Eldridge."You were in full sail for party this morning, liquor and all; thissudden tacking for a new course is a little surprising. I'mpuzzled.""Your son put it into my head," replied Mrs. Eldridge."Henry? Well, that boy does beat all!" Mr. Eldridge did not speakwith disapprobation, but with a tone of pleasure in his voice. "Andso he proposed that we should have coffee instead of wine andbrandy?""Yes.""Bravo for Henry! I like that. But what will people say, my dear? Idon't want to become a laughing stock.""I'd rather have other people laugh at me for doing right," saidMrs. Eldridge, "than to have my conscience blame me for doingwrong.""Must we give the party?" asked Mr. Eldridge, who did not feel muchinclined to brave public opinion."I don't see that we can well avoid doing so. Parties will be given,and as Fanny is our niece, it will look like a slight towards her ifwe hold back. No, she must have a party; and as I am resolved toexclude liquor, we must come in first. Who knows but all the restmay follow our example.""Don't flatter yourself on any such result. We shall stand alone,you may depend upon it."The evening of the party came and a large company assembled at thehouse of Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge. At eleven o'clock they passed to thesupper-room. On this time the thoughts of the host and hostess hadpassed, ever and anon, during the whole evening, and not withoutmany misgivings as to the effect their entertainment would produceon the minds of the company. Mr. Eldridge was particularly nervouson the subject. There were several gentlemen present whom he knew tobe lovers of good wine; gentlemen at whose houses he had often beenentertained, and never without the exhilarating glass. How wouldthey feel? What would they think? What would they say? Thesequestions fairly haunted him; and he regretted, over and over again,that he had yielded to his wife and excluded the liquors.But there was no holding back now; the die was cast, and they muststand to the issue. Mr. Eldridge tried to speak pleasantly to thelady on his arm, as he ascended to the supper-room; but the wordscame heavily from his tongue, for his heart was dying in him. Soonthe company were around the table, and eyes, critical in suchmatters, taking hurried inventories of what it contained. Settingaside the wine and brandy, the entertainment was of the most liberalcharacter, and the whole arrangement extremely elegant. At each endof the table stood a large coffee-urn, surrounded with cups, themeaning of which was not long a mystery to the company. After theterrapin, oysters, salad, and their accompaniments, Mr. Eldridgesaid to a lady, in a half-hesitating voice, as if he were almostashamed to ask the question,--"Will you have a cup of coffee?""If you please," was the smiling answer. "Nothing would suit mebetter.""Delicious!" Mr. Eldridge heard one of the gentlemen, of whom hestood most in dread, say. "This is indeed a treat. I wouldn't givesuch a cup of coffee for the best glass of wine you could bring me.""I am glad you are pleased," Mr. Eldridge could not help remarking,as he turned to the gentleman."You couldn't have pleased me better," was replied.Soon the cups were circling through the room, and every one seemedto enjoy the rich beverage. It was not the ghost of coffee, norcoffee robbed of its delicate aroma; but clear, strong, fragrant,and mellowed by the most delicious cream. Having elected to servecoffee, Mrs. Eldridge was careful that her entertainment should notprove a failure through any lack of excellence in this article. Andit was very far from proving a failure. The first surprise beingover, one and another began to express an opinion on the subject tothe host and hostess."Let me thank you," said a lady, taking the hand of Mrs. Eldridge,and speaking very warmly, "for your courage in making thisinnovation upon a custom of doubtful prudence. I thank you, as amother, who has two sons here to-night."She said no more, but Mrs. Eldridge understood well her wholemeaning."You are a brave man, and I honor you," was the remark of agentleman to Mr. Eldridge. "There will be many, I think, to followyour good example. I should never have had the courage to lead, butI think I shall be brave enough to follow, when it comes my turn toentertain my friends."Henry was standing by his father when this was said listening withrespectful, but deeply gratified attention."My son, sir," said Mr. Eldridge.The gentleman took the boy by the hand, and while he held it, thefather added,--"I must let the honor go to where it really is due. The suggestioncame from him. He is a Cadet of Temperance, and when the party wastalked of, he pleaded so earnestly for the substitution of coffeefor wine and brandy, and used such good reason for the change, thatwe saw only one right course before us, and that we have adopted."The gentleman, on hearing this, shook the lad's hand warmly, andsaid,--"Your father has reason to be proud of you, my brave boy! There isno telling what good may grew out of this thing. Others will followyour father's example, and hundreds of young men be saved from theenticements of the wine cup."With what strong throbs of pleasure did the boy's heart beat whenthese words came to his ears! He had scarcely hoped for success whenhe pleaded briefly, but earnestly, with his mother. Yet he felt thathe must speak, for to his mind, what she proposed doing was a greatevil. Since it had been resolved to banish liquor from theentertainment, he had heard his father and mother speak severaltimes doubtfully as to the result; and more than once his fatherexpressed result that any such "foolish" attempt to run in the faceof people's prejudices had been thought of. Naturally, he had feltanxious about the result; but now that the affair had gone off sotriumphantly, his heart was outgushing with pleasure.The result was as had been predicted. Four parties were given to thebride, and in each case the good example of Mrs. Eldridge wasfollowed. Coffee took the place of wine and brandy, and it was theremark of nearly all, that there had been no pleasant parties duringthe season.So much for what a boy may do, by only a few right words spoken atthe right time, and in the right manner. Henry Eldridge wasthoughtful, modest, and earnest-minded. His attachment to the causeof temperance was not a mere boyish enthusiasm, but the result of aconviction that intemperance was a vice destructive, to both souland body, and one that lay like a curse and a plague-spot onsociety, He could understand how, if the boys rejected, entirely,the cup of confusion, the next, generation of men would be sober;and this had led him to join the Cadets, and do all in his power toget other lads to join also. In drawing other lads into the order,he had been very successful; and now, in a few respectfully uttered,but earnest words, he had checked the progress of intemperance in acircle far beyond the ordinary reach of his influence.Henry Eldridge was a happy boy that night.10 Add  Coffee vs. Brandy to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Common People "Let me see. Three dozen of champagne; a dozen of sherry; a dozen ofport; a dozen of hock, and a gallon of brandy,--that will be enoughto put life into them I imagine.""Or death!" Mrs. Eldridge spoke to herself, in an undertone.Her husband, if he noticed the remark, did not reply to it, butsaid, "Good morning," and left the house. A lad about sixteen yearsof age sat in the room during this conversation, with a book in hishand and his eyes on the page before him. He did not once look up ormove; and an observer would have supposed him so much interested inhis book as not to have heard the passing conversation. But he hadlistened to every word.

The image of that boy going home to his mother atmidnight, in such a condition, and made so by my hand haunted melike a rebuking spectre; and I resolved never again to set out atable with liquors to a promiscuous company of young and old, and Ihave kept that word of promise. My husband is not willing to have aparty unless there is wine with the refreshments, and I would ratherforego all entertainments than put temptation in the way of any one.Your son's suggestion is admirable. Have the independence to actupon it, and set an example which many will be glad to follow. Don'tfear criticism or remark; don't stop to ask what this one will sayor that one think. The approval of our own consciences is worth farmore than the opinions of men. Is it right? That is the question toask; not How will it appear? or What will people say? There will bea number of parties given to your niece, without doubt; and if you,lead off with coffee instead of wine, all the rest of Fanny'sfriends may follow the good example."When Mr. Eldridge came home at dinner-time, his wife said to him,--"You needn't order any liquors from Snyder.""Why not?" Mr. Eldridge looked at his wife with some surprise."I'm going to have coffee, instead of wine, and brandy," said Mrs.Eldridge, speaking firmly."Nonsense!" You're jesting.""No, I'm in earnest. These liquors are not only expensive, butdangerous things to offer freely in mixed companies. Many boys gettheir first taste for drink at fashionable parties, and manyreformed men have the old fiery thirst revived by a glass of winepoured out for them in social hospitality. I am afraid to have myconscience burdened with the responsibility which this involves.""There is no question as to the injury that is done by this freepouring out of liquors at our fashionable entertainments. I've longenough seen that," said Mr. Eldridge; "but she will be a bold ladywho ventures to offer a cup of coffee in place of a glass of wine.You had better think twice on this subject before you act once.""I've done little else I but think about it for the last two hours,and the more I think about it the more settled my purpose becomes.""But what put this thing into your head?" inquired Mr. Eldridge."You were in full sail for party this morning, liquor and all; thissudden tacking for a new course is a little surprising. I'mpuzzled.""Your son put it into my head," replied Mrs. Eldridge."Henry? Well, that boy does beat all!" Mr. Eldridge did not speakwith disapprobation, but with a tone of pleasure in his voice. "Andso he proposed that we should have coffee instead of wine andbrandy?""Yes.""Bravo for Henry! I like that. But what will people say, my dear? Idon't want to become a laughing stock.""I'd rather have other people laugh at me for doing right," saidMrs. Eldridge, "than to have my conscience blame me for doingwrong.""Must we give the party?" asked Mr. Eldridge, who did not feel muchinclined to brave public opinion."I don't see that we can well avoid doing so. Parties will be given,and as Fanny is our niece, it will look like a slight towards her ifwe hold back. No, she must have a party; and as I am resolved toexclude liquor, we must come in first. Who knows but all the restmay follow our example.""Don't flatter yourself on any such result. We shall stand alone,you may depend upon it."The evening of the party came and a large company assembled at thehouse of Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge. At eleven o'clock they passed to thesupper-room. On this time the thoughts of the host and hostess hadpassed, ever and anon, during the whole evening, and not withoutmany misgivings as to the effect their entertainment would produceon the minds of the company. Mr. Eldridge was particularly nervouson the subject. There were several gentlemen present whom he knew tobe lovers of good wine; gentlemen at whose houses he had often beenentertained, and never without the exhilarating glass. How wouldthey feel? What would they think? What would they say? Thesequestions fairly haunted him; and he regretted, over and over again,that he had yielded to his wife and excluded the liquors.But there was no holding back now; the die was cast, and they muststand to the issue. Mr. Eldridge tried to speak pleasantly to thelady on his arm, as he ascended to the supper-room; but the wordscame heavily from his tongue, for his heart was dying in him. Soonthe company were around the table, and eyes, critical in suchmatters, taking hurried inventories of what it contained. Settingaside the wine and brandy, the entertainment was of the most liberalcharacter, and the whole arrangement extremely elegant. At each endof the table stood a large coffee-urn, surrounded with cups, themeaning of which was not long a mystery to the company. After theterrapin, oysters, salad, and their accompaniments, Mr. Eldridgesaid to a lady, in a half-hesitating voice, as if he were almostashamed to ask the question,--"Will you have a cup of coffee?""If you please," was the smiling answer. "Nothing would suit mebetter.""Delicious!" Mr. Eldridge heard one of the gentlemen, of whom hestood most in dread, say. "This is indeed a treat. I wouldn't givesuch a cup of coffee for the best glass of wine you could bring me.""I am glad you are pleased," Mr. Eldridge could not help remarking,as he turned to the gentleman."You couldn't have pleased me better," was replied.Soon the cups were circling through the room, and every one seemedto enjoy the rich beverage. It was not the ghost of coffee, norcoffee robbed of its delicate aroma; but clear, strong, fragrant,and mellowed by the most delicious cream. Having elected to servecoffee, Mrs. Eldridge was careful that her entertainment should notprove a failure through any lack of excellence in this article. Andit was very far from proving a failure. The first surprise beingover, one and another began to express an opinion on the subject tothe host and hostess."Let me thank you," said a lady, taking the hand of Mrs. Eldridge,and speaking very warmly, "for your courage in making thisinnovation upon a custom of doubtful prudence. I thank you, as amother, who has two sons here to-night."She said no more, but Mrs. Eldridge understood well her wholemeaning."You are a brave man, and I honor you," was the remark of agentleman to Mr. Eldridge. "There will be many, I think, to followyour good example. I should never have had the courage to lead, butI think I shall be brave enough to follow, when it comes my turn toentertain my friends."Henry was standing by his father when this was said listening withrespectful, but deeply gratified attention."My son, sir," said Mr. Eldridge.The gentleman took the boy by the hand, and while he held it, thefather added,--"I must let the honor go to where it really is due. The suggestioncame from him. He is a Cadet of Temperance, and when the party wastalked of, he pleaded so earnestly for the substitution of coffeefor wine and brandy, and used such good reason for the change, thatwe saw only one right course before us, and that we have adopted."The gentleman, on hearing this, shook the lad's hand warmly, andsaid,--"Your father has reason to be proud of you, my brave boy! There isno telling what good may grew out of this thing. Others will followyour father's example, and hundreds of young men be saved from theenticements of the wine cup."With what strong throbs of pleasure did the boy's heart beat whenthese words came to his ears! He had scarcely hoped for success whenhe pleaded briefly, but earnestly, with his mother. Yet he felt thathe must speak, for to his mind, what she proposed doing was a greatevil. Since it had been resolved to banish liquor from theentertainment, he had heard his father and mother speak severaltimes doubtfully as to the result; and more than once his fatherexpressed result that any such "foolish" attempt to run in the faceof people's prejudices had been thought of. Naturally, he had feltanxious about the result; but now that the affair had gone off sotriumphantly, his heart was outgushing with pleasure.The result was as had been predicted. Four parties were given to thebride, and in each case the good example of Mrs. Eldridge wasfollowed. Coffee took the place of wine and brandy, and it was theremark of nearly all, that there had been no pleasant parties duringthe season.So much for what a boy may do, by only a few right words spoken atthe right time, and in the right manner. Henry Eldridge wasthoughtful, modest, and earnest-minded. His attachment to the causeof temperance was not a mere boyish enthusiasm, but the result of aconviction that intemperance was a vice destructive, to both souland body, and one that lay like a curse and a plague-spot onsociety, He could understand how, if the boys rejected, entirely,the cup of confusion, the next, generation of men would be sober;and this had led him to join the Cadets, and do all in his power toget other lads to join also. In drawing other lads into the order,he had been very successful; and now, in a few respectfully uttered,but earnest words, he had checked the progress of intemperance in acircle far beyond the ordinary reach of his influence.Henry Eldridge was a happy boy that night.10 Add  Coffee vs. Brandy to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Common People Her husband, if he noticed the remark, did not reply to it, butsaid, "Good morning," and left the house. A lad about sixteen yearsof age sat in the room during this conversation, with a book in hishand and his eyes on the page before him. He did not once look up ormove; and an observer would have supposed him so much interested inhis book as not to have heard the passing conversation. But he hadlistened to every word. As soon as Mr. Eldridge left the room hisbook fell upon his lap, and looking towards Mrs. Eldridge, he said,in an earnest but respectful manner,--"Don't have any liquor, mother."Mrs s Eldridge looked neither offended nor irritated by thisremonstrance, as she replied,--"I wish it were possible to avoid having liquor, my son; but it isthe custom of society and if we give a party it must be in the wayit is done by other people."This did not satisfy the boy, who had been for some time associatedwith the Cadets of Temperance, and he answered, but with modesty andgreat respect of, manner,--"If other people do wrong, mother--whatthen?""I am not so sure of its being wrong, Henry.""O, but mother," spoke out the boy, quickly, "if it hurts people todrink, it must be wrong to give them liquor. Now I've been thinkinghow much better it would be to have a nice cup of coffee. I am surethat four out of five would like it a great deal better than wine orbrandy. And nobody could possibly receive any harm. Didn't you hearwhat father said about Mr. Lewis? That he had been rather wild? I amsure I shall never forget seeing him stagger in the street once. Isuppose he has reformed. But just think, if the taste should berevived again and at our house, and he should become intoxicated atthis wedding party! O, mother! It makes me feel dreadfully to thinkabout it. And dear Cousin Fanny! What sorrow it would bring to her!""O, dear, Henry! Don't talk in that kind of a way! You make meshudder all over. You're getting too much carried away by thissubject of temperance"And Mrs. Eldridge left the room to look after her domestic duties.But she could not push from her mind certain uneasy thoughts whichher son's suggestions had awakened. During the morning an intimatelady friend came in to whom Mrs. Eldridge spoke of the intendedparty."And would you believe it," she said, "that old-fashioned boy ofmine actually proposed that we should have coffee instead of wineand brandy.""And you're going to adopt the suggestion," replied the lady, herface lighten up with a pleasant smile."It would suit my own views exactly; but then such an innovationupon a common usage as that; is not to be thought of for a moment.""And why not?" asked the lady. "Coffee is safe, while wine andbrandy are always dangerous in promiscuous companies. You can nevertell in what morbid appetite you may excite an unhealthy craving.You may receive into your house a young man with intellect clear,and moral purposes well-balanced, and send him home at midnight, tohis mother, stupid from intoxication! Take your son's advice, myfriend. Exclude the wine and brandy, and give a pleasant cup ofcoffee to your guests instead.""O, dear, no, I can't do that!" said Mrs. Eldridge. "It would lookas if we were too mean to furnish wines and brandy. Besides, myhusband would never consent to it.""Let me give you a little experience of my own. It may help you to aright decision in this case."The lady spoke with some earnestness, and a sober cast of thought inher countenance. "It is now about three years since I gave a largeparty, at which a number of young men were present,--boys I shouldrather say. Among these was the son of an old and very dear friend.He was in his nineteenth year,--a handsome, intelligent, and mostagreeable person--full of life and pleasant humor. At supper time Inoticed him with a glass of champagne in his hand, gayly talkingwith some ladies. In a little while after, my eyes happening to reston him, I saw him holding, a glass of port wine to his lips, whichwas emptied at a single draught. Again passing near him, in order tospeak to a lady, I observed a tumbler in his hand, and knew thecontents to be brandy and water. This caused me to feel someconcern, and I kept him, in closer observation. In a little while hewas at the table again, pouring out another glass of wine. I thoughtit might be for a lady upon whom he was in attendance; but no, thesparkling liquor touched his own lips. When the company returned tothe parlors, the flushed face, swimming eyes, and over-hilariousmanner of my young friend, showed too plainly that he had beendrinking to excess. He was so much excited as to attract theattention of every one, and his condition became the subject ofremark. He was mortified and distressed at the occurrence, anddrawing him from the room, made free to tell him the truth. Heshowed some indignation at first, and intimated that I had insultedhim but I rebuked him sternly, and told him he had better go home. Iwas too much excited to act very wisely.

Having elected to servecoffee, Mrs. Eldridge was careful that her entertainment should notprove a failure through any lack of excellence in this article. Andit was very far from proving a failure. The first surprise beingover, one and another began to express an opinion on the subject tothe host and hostess."Let me thank you," said a lady, taking the hand of Mrs. Eldridge,and speaking very warmly, "for your courage in making thisinnovation upon a custom of doubtful prudence. I thank you, as amother, who has two sons here to-night."She said no more, but Mrs. Eldridge understood well her wholemeaning."You are a brave man, and I honor you," was the remark of agentleman to Mr. Eldridge. "There will be many, I think, to followyour good example. I should never have had the courage to lead, butI think I shall be brave enough to follow, when it comes my turn toentertain my friends."Henry was standing by his father when this was said listening withrespectful, but deeply gratified attention."My son, sir," said Mr. Eldridge.The gentleman took the boy by the hand, and while he held it, thefather added,--"I must let the honor go to where it really is due. The suggestioncame from him. He is a Cadet of Temperance, and when the party wastalked of, he pleaded so earnestly for the substitution of coffeefor wine and brandy, and used such good reason for the change, thatwe saw only one right course before us, and that we have adopted."The gentleman, on hearing this, shook the lad's hand warmly, andsaid,--"Your father has reason to be proud of you, my brave boy! There isno telling what good may grew out of this thing. Others will followyour father's example, and hundreds of young men be saved from theenticements of the wine cup."With what strong throbs of pleasure did the boy's heart beat whenthese words came to his ears! He had scarcely hoped for success whenhe pleaded briefly, but earnestly, with his mother. Yet he felt thathe must speak, for to his mind, what she proposed doing was a greatevil. Since it had been resolved to banish liquor from theentertainment, he had heard his father and mother speak severaltimes doubtfully as to the result; and more than once his fatherexpressed result that any such "foolish" attempt to run in the faceof people's prejudices had been thought of. Naturally, he had feltanxious about the result; but now that the affair had gone off sotriumphantly, his heart was outgushing with pleasure.The result was as had been predicted. Four parties were given to thebride, and in each case the good example of Mrs. Eldridge wasfollowed. Coffee took the place of wine and brandy, and it was theremark of nearly all, that there had been no pleasant parties duringthe season.So much for what a boy may do, by only a few right words spoken atthe right time, and in the right manner. Henry Eldridge wasthoughtful, modest, and earnest-minded. His attachment to the causeof temperance was not a mere boyish enthusiasm, but the result of aconviction that intemperance was a vice destructive, to both souland body, and one that lay like a curse and a plague-spot onsociety, He could understand how, if the boys rejected, entirely,the cup of confusion, the next, generation of men would be sober;and this had led him to join the Cadets, and do all in his power toget other lads to join also. In drawing other lads into the order,he had been very successful; and now, in a few respectfully uttered,but earnest words, he had checked the progress of intemperance in acircle far beyond the ordinary reach of his influence.Henry Eldridge was a happy boy that night.10 Add  Coffee vs. Brandy to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Common People Mrs s Eldridge looked neither offended nor irritated by thisremonstrance, as she replied,--"I wish it were possible to avoid having liquor, my son; but it isthe custom of society and if we give a party it must be in the wayit is done by other people."This did not satisfy the boy, who had been for some time associatedwith the Cadets of Temperance, and he answered, but with modesty andgreat respect of, manner,--"If other people do wrong, mother--whatthen?""I am not so sure of its being wrong, Henry.""O, but mother," spoke out the boy, quickly, "if it hurts people todrink, it must be wrong to give them liquor. Now I've been thinkinghow much better it would be to have a nice cup of coffee. I am surethat four out of five would like it a great deal better than wine orbrandy. And nobody could possibly receive any harm. Didn't you hearwhat father said about Mr. Lewis? That he had been rather wild? I amsure I shall never forget seeing him stagger in the street once. Isuppose he has reformed. But just think, if the taste should berevived again and at our house, and he should become intoxicated atthis wedding party! O, mother! It makes me feel dreadfully to thinkabout it. And dear Cousin Fanny! What sorrow it would bring to her!""O, dear, Henry! Don't talk in that kind of a way! You make meshudder all over. You're getting too much carried away by thissubject of temperance"And Mrs. Eldridge left the room to look after her domestic duties.But she could not push from her mind certain uneasy thoughts whichher son's suggestions had awakened. During the morning an intimatelady friend came in to whom Mrs. Eldridge spoke of the intendedparty."And would you believe it," she said, "that old-fashioned boy ofmine actually proposed that we should have coffee instead of wineand brandy.""And you're going to adopt the suggestion," replied the lady, herface lighten up with a pleasant smile."It would suit my own views exactly; but then such an innovationupon a common usage as that; is not to be thought of for a moment.""And why not?" asked the lady. "Coffee is safe, while wine andbrandy are always dangerous in promiscuous companies. You can nevertell in what morbid appetite you may excite an unhealthy craving.You may receive into your house a young man with intellect clear,and moral purposes well-balanced, and send him home at midnight, tohis mother, stupid from intoxication! Take your son's advice, myfriend. Exclude the wine and brandy, and give a pleasant cup ofcoffee to your guests instead.""O, dear, no, I can't do that!" said Mrs. Eldridge. "It would lookas if we were too mean to furnish wines and brandy. Besides, myhusband would never consent to it.""Let me give you a little experience of my own. It may help you to aright decision in this case."The lady spoke with some earnestness, and a sober cast of thought inher countenance. "It is now about three years since I gave a largeparty, at which a number of young men were present,--boys I shouldrather say. Among these was the son of an old and very dear friend.He was in his nineteenth year,--a handsome, intelligent, and mostagreeable person--full of life and pleasant humor. At supper time Inoticed him with a glass of champagne in his hand, gayly talkingwith some ladies. In a little while after, my eyes happening to reston him, I saw him holding, a glass of port wine to his lips, whichwas emptied at a single draught. Again passing near him, in order tospeak to a lady, I observed a tumbler in his hand, and knew thecontents to be brandy and water. This caused me to feel someconcern, and I kept him, in closer observation. In a little while hewas at the table again, pouring out another glass of wine. I thoughtit might be for a lady upon whom he was in attendance; but no, thesparkling liquor touched his own lips. When the company returned tothe parlors, the flushed face, swimming eyes, and over-hilariousmanner of my young friend, showed too plainly that he had beendrinking to excess. He was so much excited as to attract theattention of every one, and his condition became the subject ofremark. He was mortified and distressed at the occurrence, anddrawing him from the room, made free to tell him the truth. Heshowed some indignation at first, and intimated that I had insultedhim but I rebuked him sternly, and told him he had better go home. Iwas too much excited to act very wisely. He took me at my word, andleft the house. There was no sleep for my eyes on that night, Mrs.Eldridge. The image of that boy going home to his mother atmidnight, in such a condition, and made so by my hand haunted melike a rebuking spectre; and I resolved never again to set out atable with liquors to a promiscuous company of young and old, and Ihave kept that word of promise. My husband is not willing to have aparty unless there is wine with the refreshments, and I would ratherforego all entertainments than put temptation in the way of any one.Your son's suggestion is admirable. Have the independence to actupon it, and set an example which many will be glad to follow. Don'tfear criticism or remark; don't stop to ask what this one will sayor that one think. The approval of our own consciences is worth farmore than the opinions of men. Is it right? That is the question toask; not How will it appear? or What will people say? There will bea number of parties given to your niece, without doubt; and if you,lead off with coffee instead of wine, all the rest of Fanny'sfriends may follow the good example."When Mr. Eldridge came home at dinner-time, his wife said to him,--"You needn't order any liquors from Snyder.""Why not?" Mr. Eldridge looked at his wife with some surprise."I'm going to have coffee, instead of wine, and brandy," said Mrs.Eldridge, speaking firmly."Nonsense!" You're jesting.""No, I'm in earnest. These liquors are not only expensive, butdangerous things to offer freely in mixed companies. Many boys gettheir first taste for drink at fashionable parties, and manyreformed men have the old fiery thirst revived by a glass of winepoured out for them in social hospitality. I am afraid to have myconscience burdened with the responsibility which this involves.""There is no question as to the injury that is done by this freepouring out of liquors at our fashionable entertainments. I've longenough seen that," said Mr. Eldridge; "but she will be a bold ladywho ventures to offer a cup of coffee in place of a glass of wine.You had better think twice on this subject before you act once.""I've done little else I but think about it for the last two hours,and the more I think about it the more settled my purpose becomes.""But what put this thing into your head?" inquired Mr. Eldridge."You were in full sail for party this morning, liquor and all; thissudden tacking for a new course is a little surprising. I'mpuzzled.""Your son put it into my head," replied Mrs. Eldridge."Henry? Well, that boy does beat all!" Mr. Eldridge did not speakwith disapprobation, but with a tone of pleasure in his voice. "Andso he proposed that we should have coffee instead of wine andbrandy?""Yes.""Bravo for Henry! I like that. But what will people say, my dear? Idon't want to become a laughing stock.""I'd rather have other people laugh at me for doing right," saidMrs. Eldridge, "than to have my conscience blame me for doingwrong.""Must we give the party?" asked Mr. Eldridge, who did not feel muchinclined to brave public opinion."I don't see that we can well avoid doing so. Parties will be given,and as Fanny is our niece, it will look like a slight towards her ifwe hold back. No, she must have a party; and as I am resolved toexclude liquor, we must come in first. Who knows but all the restmay follow our example.""Don't flatter yourself on any such result. We shall stand alone,you may depend upon it."The evening of the party came and a large company assembled at thehouse of Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge. At eleven o'clock they passed to thesupper-room. On this time the thoughts of the host and hostess hadpassed, ever and anon, during the whole evening, and not withoutmany misgivings as to the effect their entertainment would produceon the minds of the company. Mr. Eldridge was particularly nervouson the subject. There were several gentlemen present whom he knew tobe lovers of good wine; gentlemen at whose houses he had often beenentertained, and never without the exhilarating glass. How wouldthey feel? What would they think? What would they say? Thesequestions fairly haunted him; and he regretted, over and over again,that he had yielded to his wife and excluded the liquors.But there was no holding back now; the die was cast, and they muststand to the issue. Mr. Eldridge tried to speak pleasantly to thelady on his arm, as he ascended to the supper-room; but the wordscame heavily from his tongue, for his heart was dying in him. Soonthe company were around the table, and eyes, critical in suchmatters, taking hurried inventories of what it contained. Settingaside the wine and brandy, the entertainment was of the most liberalcharacter, and the whole arrangement extremely elegant. At each endof the table stood a large coffee-urn, surrounded with cups, themeaning of which was not long a mystery to the company. After theterrapin, oysters, salad, and their accompaniments, Mr. Eldridgesaid to a lady, in a half-hesitating voice, as if he were almostashamed to ask the question,--"Will you have a cup of coffee?""If you please," was the smiling answer. "Nothing would suit mebetter.""Delicious!" Mr. Eldridge heard one of the gentlemen, of whom hestood most in dread, say. "This is indeed a treat. I wouldn't givesuch a cup of coffee for the best glass of wine you could bring me.""I am glad you are pleased," Mr. Eldridge could not help remarking,as he turned to the gentleman."You couldn't have pleased me better," was replied.Soon the cups were circling through the room, and every one seemedto enjoy the rich beverage. It was not the ghost of coffee, norcoffee robbed of its delicate aroma; but clear, strong, fragrant,and mellowed by the most delicious cream.

It may help you to aright decision in this case."The lady spoke with some earnestness, and a sober cast of thought inher countenance. "It is now about three years since I gave a largeparty, at which a number of young men were present,--boys I shouldrather say. Among these was the son of an old and very dear friend.He was in his nineteenth year,--a handsome, intelligent, and mostagreeable person--full of life and pleasant humor. At supper time Inoticed him with a glass of champagne in his hand, gayly talkingwith some ladies. In a little while after, my eyes happening to reston him, I saw him holding, a glass of port wine to his lips, whichwas emptied at a single draught. Again passing near him, in order tospeak to a lady, I observed a tumbler in his hand, and knew thecontents to be brandy and water. This caused me to feel someconcern, and I kept him, in closer observation. In a little while hewas at the table again, pouring out another glass of wine. I thoughtit might be for a lady upon whom he was in attendance; but no, thesparkling liquor touched his own lips. When the company returned tothe parlors, the flushed face, swimming eyes, and over-hilariousmanner of my young friend, showed too plainly that he had beendrinking to excess. He was so much excited as to attract theattention of every one, and his condition became the subject ofremark. He was mortified and distressed at the occurrence, anddrawing him from the room, made free to tell him the truth. Heshowed some indignation at first, and intimated that I had insultedhim but I rebuked him sternly, and told him he had better go home. Iwas too much excited to act very wisely. He took me at my word, andleft the house. There was no sleep for my eyes on that night, Mrs.Eldridge. The image of that boy going home to his mother atmidnight, in such a condition, and made so by my hand haunted melike a rebuking spectre; and I resolved never again to set out atable with liquors to a promiscuous company of young and old, and Ihave kept that word of promise. My husband is not willing to have aparty unless there is wine with the refreshments, and I would ratherforego all entertainments than put temptation in the way of any one.Your son's suggestion is admirable. Have the independence to actupon it, and set an example which many will be glad to follow. Don'tfear criticism or remark; don't stop to ask what this one will sayor that one think. The approval of our own consciences is worth farmore than the opinions of men. Is it right? That is the question toask; not How will it appear? or What will people say? There will bea number of parties given to your niece, without doubt; and if you,lead off with coffee instead of wine, all the rest of Fanny'sfriends may follow the good example."When Mr. Eldridge came home at dinner-time, his wife said to him,--"You needn't order any liquors from Snyder.""Why not?" Mr. Eldridge looked at his wife with some surprise."I'm going to have coffee, instead of wine, and brandy," said Mrs.Eldridge, speaking firmly."Nonsense!" You're jesting.""No, I'm in earnest. These liquors are not only expensive, butdangerous things to offer freely in mixed companies. Many boys gettheir first taste for drink at fashionable parties, and manyreformed men have the old fiery thirst revived by a glass of winepoured out for them in social hospitality. I am afraid to have myconscience burdened with the responsibility which this involves.""There is no question as to the injury that is done by this freepouring out of liquors at our fashionable entertainments. I've longenough seen that," said Mr. Eldridge; "but she will be a bold ladywho ventures to offer a cup of coffee in place of a glass of wine.You had better think twice on this subject before you act once.""I've done little else I but think about it for the last two hours,and the more I think about it the more settled my purpose becomes.""But what put this thing into your head?" inquired Mr. Eldridge."You were in full sail for party this morning, liquor and all; thissudden tacking for a new course is a little surprising. I'mpuzzled.""Your son put it into my head," replied Mrs. Eldridge."Henry? Well, that boy does beat all!" Mr. Eldridge did not speakwith disapprobation, but with a tone of pleasure in his voice. "Andso he proposed that we should have coffee instead of wine andbrandy?""Yes.""Bravo for Henry! I like that. But what will people say, my dear? Idon't want to become a laughing stock.""I'd rather have other people laugh at me for doing right," saidMrs. Eldridge, "than to have my conscience blame me for doingwrong.""Must we give the party?" asked Mr. Eldridge, who did not feel muchinclined to brave public opinion."I don't see that we can well avoid doing so. Parties will be given,and as Fanny is our niece, it will look like a slight towards her ifwe hold back. No, she must have a party; and as I am resolved toexclude liquor, we must come in first. Who knows but all the restmay follow our example.""Don't flatter yourself on any such result. We shall stand alone,you may depend upon it."The evening of the party came and a large company assembled at thehouse of Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge. At eleven o'clock they passed to thesupper-room. On this time the thoughts of the host and hostess hadpassed, ever and anon, during the whole evening, and not withoutmany misgivings as to the effect their entertainment would produceon the minds of the company. Mr. Eldridge was particularly nervouson the subject. There were several gentlemen present whom he knew tobe lovers of good wine; gentlemen at whose houses he had often beenentertained, and never without the exhilarating glass. How wouldthey feel? What would they think? What would they say? Thesequestions fairly haunted him; and he regretted, over and over again,that he had yielded to his wife and excluded the liquors.But there was no holding back now; the die was cast, and they muststand to the issue. Mr. Eldridge tried to speak pleasantly to thelady on his arm, as he ascended to the supper-room; but the wordscame heavily from his tongue, for his heart was dying in him. Soonthe company were around the table, and eyes, critical in suchmatters, taking hurried inventories of what it contained. Settingaside the wine and brandy, the entertainment was of the most liberalcharacter, and the whole arrangement extremely elegant. At each endof the table stood a large coffee-urn, surrounded with cups, themeaning of which was not long a mystery to the company. After theterrapin, oysters, salad, and their accompaniments, Mr. Eldridgesaid to a lady, in a half-hesitating voice, as if he were almostashamed to ask the question,--"Will you have a cup of coffee?""If you please," was the smiling answer. "Nothing would suit mebetter.""Delicious!" Mr. Eldridge heard one of the gentlemen, of whom hestood most in dread, say. "This is indeed a treat. I wouldn't givesuch a cup of coffee for the best glass of wine you could bring me.""I am glad you are pleased," Mr. Eldridge could not help remarking,as he turned to the gentleman."You couldn't have pleased me better," was replied.Soon the cups were circling through the room, and every one seemedto enjoy the rich beverage. It was not the ghost of coffee, norcoffee robbed of its delicate aroma; but clear, strong, fragrant,and mellowed by the most delicious cream. Having elected to servecoffee, Mrs. Eldridge was careful that her entertainment should notprove a failure through any lack of excellence in this article. Andit was very far from proving a failure. The first surprise beingover, one and another began to express an opinion on the subject tothe host and hostess."Let me thank you," said a lady, taking the hand of Mrs. Eldridge,and speaking very warmly, "for your courage in making thisinnovation upon a custom of doubtful prudence. I thank you, as amother, who has two sons here to-night."She said no more, but Mrs. Eldridge understood well her wholemeaning."You are a brave man, and I honor you," was the remark of agentleman to Mr. Eldridge. "There will be many, I think, to followyour good example. I should never have had the courage to lead, butI think I shall be brave enough to follow, when it comes my turn toentertain my friends."Henry was standing by his father when this was said listening withrespectful, but deeply gratified attention."My son, sir," said Mr. Eldridge.The gentleman took the boy by the hand, and while he held it, thefather added,--"I must let the honor go to where it really is due. The suggestioncame from him. He is a Cadet of Temperance, and when the party wastalked of, he pleaded so earnestly for the substitution of coffeefor wine and brandy, and used such good reason for the change, thatwe saw only one right course before us, and that we have adopted."The gentleman, on hearing this, shook the lad's hand warmly, andsaid,--"Your father has reason to be proud of you, my brave boy! There isno telling what good may grew out of this thing. Others will followyour father's example, and hundreds of young men be saved from theenticements of the wine cup."With what strong throbs of pleasure did the boy's heart beat whenthese words came to his ears! He had scarcely hoped for success whenhe pleaded briefly, but earnestly, with his mother. Yet he felt thathe must speak, for to his mind, what she proposed doing was a greatevil. Since it had been resolved to banish liquor from theentertainment, he had heard his father and mother speak severaltimes doubtfully as to the result; and more than once his fatherexpressed result that any such "foolish" attempt to run in the faceof people's prejudices had been thought of. Naturally, he had feltanxious about the result; but now that the affair had gone off sotriumphantly, his heart was outgushing with pleasure.The result was as had been predicted. Four parties were given to thebride, and in each case the good example of Mrs. Eldridge wasfollowed. Coffee took the place of wine and brandy, and it was theremark of nearly all, that there had been no pleasant parties duringthe season.So much for what a boy may do, by only a few right words spoken atthe right time, and in the right manner. Henry Eldridge wasthoughtful, modest, and earnest-minded. His attachment to the causeof temperance was not a mere boyish enthusiasm, but the result of aconviction that intemperance was a vice destructive, to both souland body, and one that lay like a curse and a plague-spot onsociety, He could understand how, if the boys rejected, entirely,the cup of confusion, the next, generation of men would be sober;and this had led him to join the Cadets, and do all in his power toget other lads to join also. In drawing other lads into the order,he had been very successful; and now, in a few respectfully uttered,but earnest words, he had checked the progress of intemperance in acircle far beyond the ordinary reach of his influence.Henry Eldridge was a happy boy that night.10 Add  Coffee vs. Brandy to your library.Return to the T.S.

Read the next short story; Common People "I am not so sure of its being wrong, Henry.""O, but mother," spoke out the boy, quickly, "if it hurts people todrink, it must be wrong to give them liquor. Now I've been thinkinghow much better it would be to have a nice cup of coffee. I am surethat four out of five would like it a great deal better than wine orbrandy. And nobody could possibly receive any harm. Didn't you hearwhat father said about Mr. Lewis? That he had been rather wild? I amsure I shall never forget seeing him stagger in the street once. Isuppose he has reformed. But just think, if the taste should berevived again and at our house, and he should become intoxicated atthis wedding party! O, mother! It makes me feel dreadfully to thinkabout it. And dear Cousin Fanny! What sorrow it would bring to her!""O, dear, Henry! Don't talk in that kind of a way! You make meshudder all over. You're getting too much carried away by thissubject of temperance"And Mrs. Eldridge left the room to look after her domestic duties.But she could not push from her mind certain uneasy thoughts whichher son's suggestions had awakened. During the morning an intimatelady friend came in to whom Mrs. Eldridge spoke of the intendedparty."And would you believe it," she said, "that old-fashioned boy ofmine actually proposed that we should have coffee instead of wineand brandy.""And you're going to adopt the suggestion," replied the lady, herface lighten up with a pleasant smile."It would suit my own views exactly; but then such an innovationupon a common usage as that; is not to be thought of for a moment.""And why not?" asked the lady. "Coffee is safe, while wine andbrandy are always dangerous in promiscuous companies. You can nevertell in what morbid appetite you may excite an unhealthy craving.You may receive into your house a young man with intellect clear,and moral purposes well-balanced, and send him home at midnight, tohis mother, stupid from intoxication! Take your son's advice, myfriend. Exclude the wine and brandy, and give a pleasant cup ofcoffee to your guests instead.""O, dear, no, I can't do that!" said Mrs. Eldridge.

I wouldn't givesuch a cup of coffee for the best glass of wine you could bring me.""I am glad you are pleased," Mr. Eldridge could not help remarking,as he turned to the gentleman."You couldn't have pleased me better," was replied.Soon the cups were circling through the room, and every one seemedto enjoy the rich beverage. It was not the ghost of coffee, norcoffee robbed of its delicate aroma; but clear, strong, fragrant,and mellowed by the most delicious cream. Having elected to servecoffee, Mrs. Eldridge was careful that her entertainment should notprove a failure through any lack of excellence in this article. Andit was very far from proving a failure. The first surprise beingover, one and another began to express an opinion on the subject tothe host and hostess."Let me thank you," said a lady, taking the hand of Mrs. Eldridge,and speaking very warmly, "for your courage in making thisinnovation upon a custom of doubtful prudence. I thank you, as amother, who has two sons here to-night."She said no more, but Mrs. Eldridge understood well her wholemeaning."You are a brave man, and I honor you," was the remark of agentleman to Mr. Eldridge. "There will be many, I think, to followyour good example. I should never have had the courage to lead, butI think I shall be brave enough to follow, when it comes my turn toentertain my friends."Henry was standing by his father when this was said listening withrespectful, but deeply gratified attention."My son, sir," said Mr. Eldridge.The gentleman took the boy by the hand, and while he held it, thefather added,--"I must let the honor go to where it really is due. The suggestioncame from him. He is a Cadet of Temperance, and when the party wastalked of, he pleaded so earnestly for the substitution of coffeefor wine and brandy, and used such good reason for the change, thatwe saw only one right course before us, and that we have adopted."The gentleman, on hearing this, shook the lad's hand warmly, andsaid,--"Your father has reason to be proud of you, my brave boy! There isno telling what good may grew out of this thing. Others will followyour father's example, and hundreds of young men be saved from theenticements of the wine cup."With what strong throbs of pleasure did the boy's heart beat whenthese words came to his ears! He had scarcely hoped for success whenhe pleaded briefly, but earnestly, with his mother. Yet he felt thathe must speak, for to his mind, what she proposed doing was a greatevil. Since it had been resolved to banish liquor from theentertainment, he had heard his father and mother speak severaltimes doubtfully as to the result; and more than once his fatherexpressed result that any such "foolish" attempt to run in the faceof people's prejudices had been thought of. Naturally, he had feltanxious about the result; but now that the affair had gone off sotriumphantly, his heart was outgushing with pleasure.The result was as had been predicted. Four parties were given to thebride, and in each case the good example of Mrs. Eldridge wasfollowed. Coffee took the place of wine and brandy, and it was theremark of nearly all, that there had been no pleasant parties duringthe season.So much for what a boy may do, by only a few right words spoken atthe right time, and in the right manner. Henry Eldridge wasthoughtful, modest, and earnest-minded. His attachment to the causeof temperance was not a mere boyish enthusiasm, but the result of aconviction that intemperance was a vice destructive, to both souland body, and one that lay like a curse and a plague-spot onsociety, He could understand how, if the boys rejected, entirely,the cup of confusion, the next, generation of men would be sober;and this had led him to join the Cadets, and do all in his power toget other lads to join also. In drawing other lads into the order,he had been very successful; and now, in a few respectfully uttered,but earnest words, he had checked the progress of intemperance in acircle far beyond the ordinary reach of his influence.Henry Eldridge was a happy boy that night.10 Add  Coffee vs. Brandy to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Common People "O, dear, Henry! Don't talk in that kind of a way! You make meshudder all over. You're getting too much carried away by thissubject of temperance"And Mrs. Eldridge left the room to look after her domestic duties.But she could not push from her mind certain uneasy thoughts whichher son's suggestions had awakened. During the morning an intimatelady friend came in to whom Mrs. Eldridge spoke of the intendedparty."And would you believe it," she said, "that old-fashioned boy ofmine actually proposed that we should have coffee instead of wineand brandy.""And you're going to adopt the suggestion," replied the lady, herface lighten up with a pleasant smile."It would suit my own views exactly; but then such an innovationupon a common usage as that; is not to be thought of for a moment.""And why not?" asked the lady. "Coffee is safe, while wine andbrandy are always dangerous in promiscuous companies. You can nevertell in what morbid appetite you may excite an unhealthy craving.You may receive into your house a young man with intellect clear,and moral purposes well-balanced, and send him home at midnight, tohis mother, stupid from intoxication! Take your son's advice, myfriend. Exclude the wine and brandy, and give a pleasant cup ofcoffee to your guests instead.""O, dear, no, I can't do that!" said Mrs. Eldridge. "It would lookas if we were too mean to furnish wines and brandy. Besides, myhusband would never consent to it.""Let me give you a little experience of my own. It may help you to aright decision in this case."The lady spoke with some earnestness, and a sober cast of thought inher countenance. "It is now about three years since I gave a largeparty, at which a number of young men were present,--boys I shouldrather say. Among these was the son of an old and very dear friend.He was in his nineteenth year,--a handsome, intelligent, and mostagreeable person--full of life and pleasant humor. At supper time Inoticed him with a glass of champagne in his hand, gayly talkingwith some ladies. In a little while after, my eyes happening to reston him, I saw him holding, a glass of port wine to his lips, whichwas emptied at a single draught. Again passing near him, in order tospeak to a lady, I observed a tumbler in his hand, and knew thecontents to be brandy and water. This caused me to feel someconcern, and I kept him, in closer observation. In a little while hewas at the table again, pouring out another glass of wine. I thoughtit might be for a lady upon whom he was in attendance; but no, thesparkling liquor touched his own lips. When the company returned tothe parlors, the flushed face, swimming eyes, and over-hilariousmanner of my young friend, showed too plainly that he had beendrinking to excess. He was so much excited as to attract theattention of every one, and his condition became the subject ofremark. He was mortified and distressed at the occurrence, anddrawing him from the room, made free to tell him the truth. Heshowed some indignation at first, and intimated that I had insultedhim but I rebuked him sternly, and told him he had better go home. Iwas too much excited to act very wisely. He took me at my word, andleft the house. There was no sleep for my eyes on that night, Mrs.Eldridge. The image of that boy going home to his mother atmidnight, in such a condition, and made so by my hand haunted melike a rebuking spectre; and I resolved never again to set out atable with liquors to a promiscuous company of young and old, and Ihave kept that word of promise. My husband is not willing to have aparty unless there is wine with the refreshments, and I would ratherforego all entertainments than put temptation in the way of any one.Your son's suggestion is admirable. Have the independence to actupon it, and set an example which many will be glad to follow. Don'tfear criticism or remark; don't stop to ask what this one will sayor that one think. The approval of our own consciences is worth farmore than the opinions of men. Is it right? That is the question toask; not How will it appear? or What will people say? There will bea number of parties given to your niece, without doubt; and if you,lead off with coffee instead of wine, all the rest of Fanny'sfriends may follow the good example."When Mr. Eldridge came home at dinner-time, his wife said to him,--"You needn't order any liquors from Snyder.""Why not?" Mr. Eldridge looked at his wife with some surprise."I'm going to have coffee, instead of wine, and brandy," said Mrs.Eldridge, speaking firmly."Nonsense!" You're jesting.""No, I'm in earnest. These liquors are not only expensive, butdangerous things to offer freely in mixed companies. Many boys gettheir first taste for drink at fashionable parties, and manyreformed men have the old fiery thirst revived by a glass of winepoured out for them in social hospitality. I am afraid to have myconscience burdened with the responsibility which this involves.""There is no question as to the injury that is done by this freepouring out of liquors at our fashionable entertainments. I've longenough seen that," said Mr. Eldridge; "but she will be a bold ladywho ventures to offer a cup of coffee in place of a glass of wine.You had better think twice on this subject before you act once.""I've done little else I but think about it for the last two hours,and the more I think about it the more settled my purpose becomes.""But what put this thing into your head?" inquired Mr. Eldridge."You were in full sail for party this morning, liquor and all; thissudden tacking for a new course is a little surprising. I'mpuzzled.""Your son put it into my head," replied Mrs. Eldridge."Henry? Well, that boy does beat all!" Mr. Eldridge did not speakwith disapprobation, but with a tone of pleasure in his voice. "Andso he proposed that we should have coffee instead of wine andbrandy?""Yes.""Bravo for Henry! I like that. But what will people say, my dear? Idon't want to become a laughing stock.""I'd rather have other people laugh at me for doing right," saidMrs. Eldridge, "than to have my conscience blame me for doingwrong.""Must we give the party?" asked Mr. Eldridge, who did not feel muchinclined to brave public opinion."I don't see that we can well avoid doing so. Parties will be given,and as Fanny is our niece, it will look like a slight towards her ifwe hold back. No, she must have a party; and as I am resolved toexclude liquor, we must come in first. Who knows but all the restmay follow our example.""Don't flatter yourself on any such result. We shall stand alone,you may depend upon it."The evening of the party came and a large company assembled at thehouse of Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge. At eleven o'clock they passed to thesupper-room. On this time the thoughts of the host and hostess hadpassed, ever and anon, during the whole evening, and not withoutmany misgivings as to the effect their entertainment would produceon the minds of the company. Mr. Eldridge was particularly nervouson the subject. There were several gentlemen present whom he knew tobe lovers of good wine; gentlemen at whose houses he had often beenentertained, and never without the exhilarating glass. How wouldthey feel? What would they think? What would they say? Thesequestions fairly haunted him; and he regretted, over and over again,that he had yielded to his wife and excluded the liquors.But there was no holding back now; the die was cast, and they muststand to the issue. Mr. Eldridge tried to speak pleasantly to thelady on his arm, as he ascended to the supper-room; but the wordscame heavily from his tongue, for his heart was dying in him. Soonthe company were around the table, and eyes, critical in suchmatters, taking hurried inventories of what it contained. Settingaside the wine and brandy, the entertainment was of the most liberalcharacter, and the whole arrangement extremely elegant. At each endof the table stood a large coffee-urn, surrounded with cups, themeaning of which was not long a mystery to the company. After theterrapin, oysters, salad, and their accompaniments, Mr. Eldridgesaid to a lady, in a half-hesitating voice, as if he were almostashamed to ask the question,--"Will you have a cup of coffee?""If you please," was the smiling answer.

I've longenough seen that," said Mr. Eldridge; "but she will be a bold ladywho ventures to offer a cup of coffee in place of a glass of wine.You had better think twice on this subject before you act once.""I've done little else I but think about it for the last two hours,and the more I think about it the more settled my purpose becomes.""But what put this thing into your head?" inquired Mr. Eldridge."You were in full sail for party this morning, liquor and all; thissudden tacking for a new course is a little surprising. I'mpuzzled.""Your son put it into my head," replied Mrs. Eldridge."Henry? Well, that boy does beat all!" Mr. Eldridge did not speakwith disapprobation, but with a tone of pleasure in his voice. "Andso he proposed that we should have coffee instead of wine andbrandy?""Yes.""Bravo for Henry! I like that. But what will people say, my dear? Idon't want to become a laughing stock.""I'd rather have other people laugh at me for doing right," saidMrs. Eldridge, "than to have my conscience blame me for doingwrong.""Must we give the party?" asked Mr. Eldridge, who did not feel muchinclined to brave public opinion."I don't see that we can well avoid doing so. Parties will be given,and as Fanny is our niece, it will look like a slight towards her ifwe hold back. No, she must have a party; and as I am resolved toexclude liquor, we must come in first. Who knows but all the restmay follow our example.""Don't flatter yourself on any such result. We shall stand alone,you may depend upon it."The evening of the party came and a large company assembled at thehouse of Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge. At eleven o'clock they passed to thesupper-room. On this time the thoughts of the host and hostess hadpassed, ever and anon, during the whole evening, and not withoutmany misgivings as to the effect their entertainment would produceon the minds of the company. Mr. Eldridge was particularly nervouson the subject. There were several gentlemen present whom he knew tobe lovers of good wine; gentlemen at whose houses he had often beenentertained, and never without the exhilarating glass. How wouldthey feel? What would they think? What would they say? Thesequestions fairly haunted him; and he regretted, over and over again,that he had yielded to his wife and excluded the liquors.But there was no holding back now; the die was cast, and they muststand to the issue. Mr. Eldridge tried to speak pleasantly to thelady on his arm, as he ascended to the supper-room; but the wordscame heavily from his tongue, for his heart was dying in him. Soonthe company were around the table, and eyes, critical in suchmatters, taking hurried inventories of what it contained. Settingaside the wine and brandy, the entertainment was of the most liberalcharacter, and the whole arrangement extremely elegant. At each endof the table stood a large coffee-urn, surrounded with cups, themeaning of which was not long a mystery to the company. After theterrapin, oysters, salad, and their accompaniments, Mr. Eldridgesaid to a lady, in a half-hesitating voice, as if he were almostashamed to ask the question,--"Will you have a cup of coffee?""If you please," was the smiling answer. "Nothing would suit mebetter.""Delicious!" Mr. Eldridge heard one of the gentlemen, of whom hestood most in dread, say. "This is indeed a treat. I wouldn't givesuch a cup of coffee for the best glass of wine you could bring me.""I am glad you are pleased," Mr. Eldridge could not help remarking,as he turned to the gentleman."You couldn't have pleased me better," was replied.Soon the cups were circling through the room, and every one seemedto enjoy the rich beverage. It was not the ghost of coffee, norcoffee robbed of its delicate aroma; but clear, strong, fragrant,and mellowed by the most delicious cream. Having elected to servecoffee, Mrs. Eldridge was careful that her entertainment should notprove a failure through any lack of excellence in this article. Andit was very far from proving a failure. The first surprise beingover, one and another began to express an opinion on the subject tothe host and hostess."Let me thank you," said a lady, taking the hand of Mrs. Eldridge,and speaking very warmly, "for your courage in making thisinnovation upon a custom of doubtful prudence. I thank you, as amother, who has two sons here to-night."She said no more, but Mrs. Eldridge understood well her wholemeaning."You are a brave man, and I honor you," was the remark of agentleman to Mr. Eldridge. "There will be many, I think, to followyour good example. I should never have had the courage to lead, butI think I shall be brave enough to follow, when it comes my turn toentertain my friends."Henry was standing by his father when this was said listening withrespectful, but deeply gratified attention."My son, sir," said Mr. Eldridge.The gentleman took the boy by the hand, and while he held it, thefather added,--"I must let the honor go to where it really is due. The suggestioncame from him. He is a Cadet of Temperance, and when the party wastalked of, he pleaded so earnestly for the substitution of coffeefor wine and brandy, and used such good reason for the change, thatwe saw only one right course before us, and that we have adopted."The gentleman, on hearing this, shook the lad's hand warmly, andsaid,--"Your father has reason to be proud of you, my brave boy! There isno telling what good may grew out of this thing. Others will followyour father's example, and hundreds of young men be saved from theenticements of the wine cup."With what strong throbs of pleasure did the boy's heart beat whenthese words came to his ears! He had scarcely hoped for success whenhe pleaded briefly, but earnestly, with his mother. Yet he felt thathe must speak, for to his mind, what she proposed doing was a greatevil. Since it had been resolved to banish liquor from theentertainment, he had heard his father and mother speak severaltimes doubtfully as to the result; and more than once his fatherexpressed result that any such "foolish" attempt to run in the faceof people's prejudices had been thought of. Naturally, he had feltanxious about the result; but now that the affair had gone off sotriumphantly, his heart was outgushing with pleasure.The result was as had been predicted. Four parties were given to thebride, and in each case the good example of Mrs. Eldridge wasfollowed. Coffee took the place of wine and brandy, and it was theremark of nearly all, that there had been no pleasant parties duringthe season.So much for what a boy may do, by only a few right words spoken atthe right time, and in the right manner. Henry Eldridge wasthoughtful, modest, and earnest-minded. His attachment to the causeof temperance was not a mere boyish enthusiasm, but the result of aconviction that intemperance was a vice destructive, to both souland body, and one that lay like a curse and a plague-spot onsociety, He could understand how, if the boys rejected, entirely,the cup of confusion, the next, generation of men would be sober;and this had led him to join the Cadets, and do all in his power toget other lads to join also. In drawing other lads into the order,he had been very successful; and now, in a few respectfully uttered,but earnest words, he had checked the progress of intemperance in acircle far beyond the ordinary reach of his influence.Henry Eldridge was a happy boy that night.10 Add  Coffee vs. Brandy to your library.Return to the T.S.

Read the next short story; Common People "And you're going to adopt the suggestion," replied the lady, herface lighten up with a pleasant smile."It would suit my own views exactly; but then such an innovationupon a common usage as that; is not to be thought of for a moment.""And why not?" asked the lady. "Coffee is safe, while wine andbrandy are always dangerous in promiscuous companies. You can nevertell in what morbid appetite you may excite an unhealthy craving.You may receive into your house a young man with intellect clear,and moral purposes well-balanced, and send him home at midnight, tohis mother, stupid from intoxication! Take your son's advice, myfriend. Exclude the wine and brandy, and give a pleasant cup ofcoffee to your guests instead.""O, dear, no, I can't do that!" said Mrs. Eldridge. "It would lookas if we were too mean to furnish wines and brandy. Besides, myhusband would never consent to it.""Let me give you a little experience of my own. It may help you to aright decision in this case."The lady spoke with some earnestness, and a sober cast of thought inher countenance. "It is now about three years since I gave a largeparty, at which a number of young men were present,--boys I shouldrather say. Among these was the son of an old and very dear friend.He was in his nineteenth year,--a handsome, intelligent, and mostagreeable person--full of life and pleasant humor. At supper time Inoticed him with a glass of champagne in his hand, gayly talkingwith some ladies. In a little while after, my eyes happening to reston him, I saw him holding, a glass of port wine to his lips, whichwas emptied at a single draught. Again passing near him, in order tospeak to a lady, I observed a tumbler in his hand, and knew thecontents to be brandy and water. This caused me to feel someconcern, and I kept him, in closer observation. In a little while hewas at the table again, pouring out another glass of wine. I thoughtit might be for a lady upon whom he was in attendance; but no, thesparkling liquor touched his own lips. When the company returned tothe parlors, the flushed face, swimming eyes, and over-hilariousmanner of my young friend, showed too plainly that he had beendrinking to excess. He was so much excited as to attract theattention of every one, and his condition became the subject ofremark. He was mortified and distressed at the occurrence, anddrawing him from the room, made free to tell him the truth. Heshowed some indignation at first, and intimated that I had insultedhim but I rebuked him sternly, and told him he had better go home. Iwas too much excited to act very wisely. He took me at my word, andleft the house. There was no sleep for my eyes on that night, Mrs.Eldridge. The image of that boy going home to his mother atmidnight, in such a condition, and made so by my hand haunted melike a rebuking spectre; and I resolved never again to set out atable with liquors to a promiscuous company of young and old, and Ihave kept that word of promise. My husband is not willing to have aparty unless there is wine with the refreshments, and I would ratherforego all entertainments than put temptation in the way of any one.Your son's suggestion is admirable. Have the independence to actupon it, and set an example which many will be glad to follow. Don'tfear criticism or remark; don't stop to ask what this one will sayor that one think. The approval of our own consciences is worth farmore than the opinions of men. Is it right? That is the question toask; not How will it appear? or What will people say? There will bea number of parties given to your niece, without doubt; and if you,lead off with coffee instead of wine, all the rest of Fanny'sfriends may follow the good example."When Mr. Eldridge came home at dinner-time, his wife said to him,--"You needn't order any liquors from Snyder.""Why not?" Mr. Eldridge looked at his wife with some surprise."I'm going to have coffee, instead of wine, and brandy," said Mrs.Eldridge, speaking firmly."Nonsense!" You're jesting.""No, I'm in earnest. These liquors are not only expensive, butdangerous things to offer freely in mixed companies. Many boys gettheir first taste for drink at fashionable parties, and manyreformed men have the old fiery thirst revived by a glass of winepoured out for them in social hospitality.

He took me at my word, andleft the house. There was no sleep for my eyes on that night, Mrs.Eldridge. The image of that boy going home to his mother atmidnight, in such a condition, and made so by my hand haunted melike a rebuking spectre; and I resolved never again to set out atable with liquors to a promiscuous company of young and old, and Ihave kept that word of promise. My husband is not willing to have aparty unless there is wine with the refreshments, and I would ratherforego all entertainments than put temptation in the way of any one.Your son's suggestion is admirable. Have the independence to actupon it, and set an example which many will be glad to follow. Don'tfear criticism or remark; don't stop to ask what this one will sayor that one think. The approval of our own consciences is worth farmore than the opinions of men. Is it right? That is the question toask; not How will it appear? or What will people say? There will bea number of parties given to your niece, without doubt; and if you,lead off with coffee instead of wine, all the rest of Fanny'sfriends may follow the good example."When Mr. Eldridge came home at dinner-time, his wife said to him,--"You needn't order any liquors from Snyder.""Why not?" Mr. Eldridge looked at his wife with some surprise."I'm going to have coffee, instead of wine, and brandy," said Mrs.Eldridge, speaking firmly."Nonsense!" You're jesting.""No, I'm in earnest. These liquors are not only expensive, butdangerous things to offer freely in mixed companies. Many boys gettheir first taste for drink at fashionable parties, and manyreformed men have the old fiery thirst revived by a glass of winepoured out for them in social hospitality. I am afraid to have myconscience burdened with the responsibility which this involves.""There is no question as to the injury that is done by this freepouring out of liquors at our fashionable entertainments. I've longenough seen that," said Mr. Eldridge; "but she will be a bold ladywho ventures to offer a cup of coffee in place of a glass of wine.You had better think twice on this subject before you act once.""I've done little else I but think about it for the last two hours,and the more I think about it the more settled my purpose becomes.""But what put this thing into your head?" inquired Mr. Eldridge."You were in full sail for party this morning, liquor and all; thissudden tacking for a new course is a little surprising. I'mpuzzled.""Your son put it into my head," replied Mrs. Eldridge."Henry? Well, that boy does beat all!" Mr. Eldridge did not speakwith disapprobation, but with a tone of pleasure in his voice. "Andso he proposed that we should have coffee instead of wine andbrandy?""Yes.""Bravo for Henry! I like that. But what will people say, my dear? Idon't want to become a laughing stock.""I'd rather have other people laugh at me for doing right," saidMrs. Eldridge, "than to have my conscience blame me for doingwrong.""Must we give the party?" asked Mr. Eldridge, who did not feel muchinclined to brave public opinion."I don't see that we can well avoid doing so. Parties will be given,and as Fanny is our niece, it will look like a slight towards her ifwe hold back. No, she must have a party; and as I am resolved toexclude liquor, we must come in first. Who knows but all the restmay follow our example.""Don't flatter yourself on any such result. We shall stand alone,you may depend upon it."The evening of the party came and a large company assembled at thehouse of Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge. At eleven o'clock they passed to thesupper-room. On this time the thoughts of the host and hostess hadpassed, ever and anon, during the whole evening, and not withoutmany misgivings as to the effect their entertainment would produceon the minds of the company. Mr. Eldridge was particularly nervouson the subject. There were several gentlemen present whom he knew tobe lovers of good wine; gentlemen at whose houses he had often beenentertained, and never without the exhilarating glass. How wouldthey feel? What would they think? What would they say? Thesequestions fairly haunted him; and he regretted, over and over again,that he had yielded to his wife and excluded the liquors.But there was no holding back now; the die was cast, and they muststand to the issue. Mr. Eldridge tried to speak pleasantly to thelady on his arm, as he ascended to the supper-room; but the wordscame heavily from his tongue, for his heart was dying in him. Soonthe company were around the table, and eyes, critical in suchmatters, taking hurried inventories of what it contained. Settingaside the wine and brandy, the entertainment was of the most liberalcharacter, and the whole arrangement extremely elegant. At each endof the table stood a large coffee-urn, surrounded with cups, themeaning of which was not long a mystery to the company. After theterrapin, oysters, salad, and their accompaniments, Mr. Eldridgesaid to a lady, in a half-hesitating voice, as if he were almostashamed to ask the question,--"Will you have a cup of coffee?""If you please," was the smiling answer. "Nothing would suit mebetter.""Delicious!" Mr. Eldridge heard one of the gentlemen, of whom hestood most in dread, say. "This is indeed a treat. I wouldn't givesuch a cup of coffee for the best glass of wine you could bring me.""I am glad you are pleased," Mr. Eldridge could not help remarking,as he turned to the gentleman."You couldn't have pleased me better," was replied.Soon the cups were circling through the room, and every one seemedto enjoy the rich beverage. It was not the ghost of coffee, norcoffee robbed of its delicate aroma; but clear, strong, fragrant,and mellowed by the most delicious cream. Having elected to servecoffee, Mrs. Eldridge was careful that her entertainment should notprove a failure through any lack of excellence in this article. Andit was very far from proving a failure. The first surprise beingover, one and another began to express an opinion on the subject tothe host and hostess."Let me thank you," said a lady, taking the hand of Mrs. Eldridge,and speaking very warmly, "for your courage in making thisinnovation upon a custom of doubtful prudence. I thank you, as amother, who has two sons here to-night."She said no more, but Mrs. Eldridge understood well her wholemeaning."You are a brave man, and I honor you," was the remark of agentleman to Mr. Eldridge. "There will be many, I think, to followyour good example. I should never have had the courage to lead, butI think I shall be brave enough to follow, when it comes my turn toentertain my friends."Henry was standing by his father when this was said listening withrespectful, but deeply gratified attention."My son, sir," said Mr. Eldridge.The gentleman took the boy by the hand, and while he held it, thefather added,--"I must let the honor go to where it really is due. The suggestioncame from him. He is a Cadet of Temperance, and when the party wastalked of, he pleaded so earnestly for the substitution of coffeefor wine and brandy, and used such good reason for the change, thatwe saw only one right course before us, and that we have adopted."The gentleman, on hearing this, shook the lad's hand warmly, andsaid,--"Your father has reason to be proud of you, my brave boy! There isno telling what good may grew out of this thing. Others will followyour father's example, and hundreds of young men be saved from theenticements of the wine cup."With what strong throbs of pleasure did the boy's heart beat whenthese words came to his ears! He had scarcely hoped for success whenhe pleaded briefly, but earnestly, with his mother. Yet he felt thathe must speak, for to his mind, what she proposed doing was a greatevil. Since it had been resolved to banish liquor from theentertainment, he had heard his father and mother speak severaltimes doubtfully as to the result; and more than once his fatherexpressed result that any such "foolish" attempt to run in the faceof people's prejudices had been thought of. Naturally, he had feltanxious about the result; but now that the affair had gone off sotriumphantly, his heart was outgushing with pleasure.The result was as had been predicted. Four parties were given to thebride, and in each case the good example of Mrs. Eldridge wasfollowed. Coffee took the place of wine and brandy, and it was theremark of nearly all, that there had been no pleasant parties duringthe season.So much for what a boy may do, by only a few right words spoken atthe right time, and in the right manner. Henry Eldridge wasthoughtful, modest, and earnest-minded. His attachment to the causeof temperance was not a mere boyish enthusiasm, but the result of aconviction that intemperance was a vice destructive, to both souland body, and one that lay like a curse and a plague-spot onsociety, He could understand how, if the boys rejected, entirely,the cup of confusion, the next, generation of men would be sober;and this had led him to join the Cadets, and do all in his power toget other lads to join also. In drawing other lads into the order,he had been very successful; and now, in a few respectfully uttered,but earnest words, he had checked the progress of intemperance in acircle far beyond the ordinary reach of his influence.Henry Eldridge was a happy boy that night.10 Add  Coffee vs. Brandy to your library.Return to the T.S. Arthur library, or . . . Read the next short story; Common People "O, dear, no, I can't do that!" said Mrs. Eldridge. "It would lookas if we were too mean to furnish wines and brandy. Besides, myhusband would never consent to it.""Let me give you a little experience of my own. It may help you to aright decision in this case."The lady spoke with some earnestness, and a sober cast of thought inher countenance. "It is now about three years since I gave a largeparty, at which a number of young men were present,--boys I shouldrather say. Among these was the son of an old and very dear friend.He was in his nineteenth year,--a handsome, intelligent, and mostagreeable person--full of life and pleasant humor. At supper time Inoticed him with a glass of champagne in his hand, gayly talkingwith some ladies. In a little while after, my eyes happening to reston him, I saw him holding, a glass of port wine to his lips, whichwas emptied at a single draught. Again passing near him, in order tospeak to a lady, I observed a tumbler in his hand, and knew thecontents to be brandy and water. This caused me to feel someconcern, and I kept him, in closer observation. In a little while hewas at the table again, pouring out another glass of wine. I thoughtit might be for a lady upon whom he was in attendance; but no, thesparkling liquor touched his own lips. When the company returned tothe parlors, the flushed face, swimming eyes, and over-hilariousmanner of my young friend, showed too plainly that he had beendrinking to excess. He was so much excited as to attract theattention of every one, and his condition became the subject ofremark.

My husband is not willing to have aparty unless there is wine with the refreshments, and I would ratherforego all entertainments than put temptation in the way of any one.Your son's suggestion is admirable. Have the independence to actupon it, and set an example which many will be glad to follow. Don'tfear criticism or remark; don't stop to ask what this one will sayor that one think. The approval of our own consciences is worth farmore than the opinions of men. Is it right? That is the question toask; not How will it appear? or What will people say? There will bea number of parties given to your niece, without doubt; and if you,lead off with coffee instead of wine, all the rest of Fanny'sfriends may follow the good example."When Mr. Eldridge came home at dinner-time, his wife said to him,--"You needn't order any liquors from Snyder.""Why not?" Mr. Eldridge looked at his wife with some surprise."I'm going to have coffee, instead of wine, and brandy," said Mrs.Eldridge, speaking firmly."Nonsense!" You're jesting.""No, I'm in earnest. These liquors are not only expensive, butdangerous things to offer freely in mixed companies. Many boys gettheir first taste for drink at fashionable parties, and manyreformed men have the old fiery thirst revived by a glass of winepoured out for them in social hospitality. I am afraid to have myconscience burdened with the responsibility which this involves.""There is no question as to the injury that is done by this freepouring out of liquors at our fashionable entertainments. I've longenough seen that," said Mr. Eldridge; "but she will be a bold ladywho ventures to offer a cup of coffee in place of a glass of wine.You had better think twice on this subject before you act once.""I've done little else I but think about it for the last two hours,and the more I think about it the more settled my purpose becomes.""But what put this thing into your head?" inquired Mr. Eldridge."You were in full sail for party this morning, liquor and all; thissudden tacking for a new course is a little surprising. I'mpuzzled.""Your son put it into my head," replied Mrs. Eldridge."Henry? Well, that boy does beat all!" Mr. Eldridge did not speakwith disapprobation, but with a tone of pleasure in his voice. "Andso he proposed that we should have coffee instead of wine andbrandy?""Yes.""Bravo for Henry! I like that. But what will people say, my dear? Idon't want to become a laughing stock.""I'd rather have other people laugh at me for doing right," saidMrs. Eldridge, "than to have my conscience blame me for doingwrong.""Must we give the party?" asked Mr. Eldridge, who did not feel muchinclined to brave public opinion."I don't see that we can well avoid doing so. Parties will be given,and as Fanny is our niece, it will look like a slight towards her ifwe hold back. No, she must have a party; and as I am resolved toexclude liquor, we must come in first. Who knows but all the restmay follow our example.""Don't flatter yourself on any such result. We shall stand alone,you may depend upon it."The evening of the party came and a large company assembled at thehouse of Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge. At eleven o'clock they passed to thesupper-room. On this time the thoughts of the host and hostess hadpassed, ever and anon, during the whole evening, and not withoutmany misgivings as to the effect their entertainment would produceon the minds of the company. Mr. Eldridge was particularly nervouson the subject. There were several gentlemen present whom he knew tobe lovers of good wine; gentlemen at whose houses he had often beenentertained, and never without the exhilarating glass. How wouldthey feel? What would they think? What would they say? Thesequestions fairly haunted him; and he regretted, over and over again,that he had yielded to his wife and excluded the liquors.But there was no holding back now; the die was cast, and they muststand to the issue. Mr. Eldridge tried to speak pleasantly to thelady on his arm, as he ascended to the supper-room; but the wordscame heavily from his tongue, for his heart was dying in him. Soonthe company were around the table, and eyes, critical in suchmatters, taking hurried inventories of what it contained. Settingaside the wine and brandy, the entertainment was of the most liberalcharacter, and the whole arrangement extremely elegant. At each endof the table stood a large coffee-urn, surrounded with cups, themeaning of which was not long a mystery to the company. After theterrapin, oysters, salad, and their accompaniments, Mr. Eldridgesaid to a lady, in a half-hesitating voice, as if he were almostashamed to ask the question,--"Will you have a cup of coffee?""If you please," was the smiling answer. "Nothing would suit mebetter.""Delicious!" Mr. Eldridge heard one of the gentlemen, of whom hestood most in dread, say. "This is indeed a treat. I wouldn't givesuch a cup of coffee for the best glass of wine you could bring me.""I am glad you are pleased," Mr. Eldridge could not help remarking,as he turned to the gentleman."You couldn't have pleased me better," was replied.Soon the cups were circling through the room, and every one seemedto enjoy the rich beverage. It was not the ghost of coffee, norcoffee robbed of its delicate aroma; but clear, strong, fragrant,and mellowed by the most delicious cream. Having elected to servecoffee, Mrs. Eldridge was careful that her entertainment should notprove a failure through any lack of excellence in this article. Andit was very far from proving a failure. The first surprise beingover, one and another began to express an opinion on the subject tothe host and hostess."Let me thank you," said a lady, taking the hand of Mrs. Eldridge,and speaking very warmly, "for your courage in making thisinnovation upon a custom of doubtful prudence. I thank you, as amother, who has two sons here to-night."She said no more, but Mrs. Eldridge understood well her wholemeaning."You are a brave man, and I honor you," was the remark of agentleman to Mr. Eldridge. "There will be many, I think, to followyour good example. I should never have had the courage to lead, butI think I shall be brave enough to follow, when it comes my turn toentertain my friends."Henry was standing by his father when this was said listening withrespectful, but deeply gratified attention."My son, sir," said Mr. Eldridge.The gentleman took the boy by the hand, and while he held it, thefather added,--"I must let the honor go to where it really is due. The suggestioncame from him. He is a Cadet of Temperance, and when the party wastalked of, he pleaded so earnestly for the substitution of coffeefor wine and brandy, and used such good reason for the change, thatwe saw only one right course before us, and that we have adopted."The gentleman, on hearing this, shook the lad's hand warmly, andsaid,--"Your father has reason to be proud of you, my brave boy! There isno telling what good may grew out of this thing. Others will followyour father's example, and hundreds of young men be saved from theenticements of the wine cup."With what strong throbs of pleasure did the boy's heart beat whenthese words came to his ears! He had scarcely hoped for success whenhe pleaded briefly, but earnestly, with his mother. Yet he felt thathe must speak, for to his mind, what she proposed doing was a greatevil. Since it had been resolved to banish liquor from theentertainment, he had heard his father and mother speak severaltimes doubtfully as to the result; and more than once his fatherexpressed result that any such "foolish" attempt to run in the faceof people's prejudices had been thought of. Naturally, he had feltanxious about the result; but now that the affair had gone off sotriumphantly, his heart was outgushing with pleasure.The result was as had been predicted. Four parties were given to thebride, and in each case the good example of Mrs. Eldridge wasfollowed. Coffee took the place of wine and brandy, and it was theremark of nearly all, that there had been no pleasant parties duringthe season.So much for what a boy may do, by only a few right words spoken atthe right time, and in the right manner. Henry Eldridge wasthoughtful, modest, and earnest-minded. His attachment to the causeof temperance was not a mere boyish enthusiasm, but the result of aconviction that intemperance was a vice destructive, to both souland body, and one that lay like a curse and a plague-spot onsociety, He could understand how, if the boys rejected, entirely,the cup of confusion, the next, generation of men would be sober;and this had led him to join the Cadets, and do all in his power toget other lads to join also. In drawing other lads into the order,he had been very successful; and now, in a few respectfully uttered,but earnest words, he had checked the progress of intemperance in acircle far beyond the ordinary reach of his influence.Henry Eldridge was a happy boy that night.10 Add  Coffee vs. Brandy to your library.Return to the T.S.

You're jesting.""No, I'm in earnest. These liquors are not only expensive, butdangerous things to offer freely in mixed companies. Many boys gettheir first taste for drink at fashionable parties, and manyreformed men have the old fiery thirst revived by a glass of winepoured out for them in social hospitality. I am afraid to have myconscience burdened with the responsibility which this involves.""There is no question as to the injury that is done by this freepouring out of liquors at our fashionable entertainments. I've longenough seen that," said Mr. Eldridge; "but she will be a bold ladywho ventures to offer a cup of coffee in place of a glass of wine.You had better think twice on this subject before you act once.""I've done little else I but think about it for the last two hours,and the more I think about it the more settled my purpose becomes.""But what put this thing into your head?" inquired Mr. Eldridge."You were in full sail for party this morning, liquor and all; thissudden tacking for a new course is a little surprising. I'mpuzzled.""Your son put it into my head," replied Mrs. Eldridge."Henry? Well, that boy does beat all!" Mr. Eldridge did not speakwith disapprobation, but with a tone of pleasure in his voice. "Andso he proposed that we should have coffee instead of wine andbrandy?""Yes.""Bravo for Henry! I like that. But what will people say, my dear? Idon't want to become a laughing stock.""I'd rather have other people laugh at me for doing right," saidMrs. Eldridge, "than to have my conscience blame me for doingwrong.""Must we give the party?" asked Mr. Eldridge, who did not feel muchinclined to brave public opinion."I don't see that we can well avoid doing so. Parties will be given,and as Fanny is our niece, it will look like a slight towards her ifwe hold back. No, she must have a party; and as I am resolved toexclude liquor, we must come in first. Who knows but all the restmay follow our example.""Don't flatter yourself on any such result. We shall stand alone,you may depend upon it."The evening of the party came and a large company assembled at thehouse of Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge. At eleven o'clock they passed to thesupper-room. On this time the thoughts of the host and hostess hadpassed, ever and anon, during the whole evening, and not withoutmany misgivings as to the effect their entertainment would produceon the minds of the company. Mr. Eldridge was particularly nervouson the subject. There were several gentlemen present whom he knew tobe lovers of good wine; gentlemen at whose houses he had often beenentertained, and never without the exhilarating glass. How wouldthey feel? What would they think? What would they say? Thesequestions fairly haunted him; and he regretted, over and over again,that he had yielded to his wife and excluded the liquors.But there was no holding back now; the die was cast, and they muststand to the issue. Mr. Eldridge tried to speak pleasantly to thelady on his arm, as he ascended to the supper-room; but the wordscame heavily from his tongue, for his heart was dying in him. Soonthe company were around the table, and eyes, critical in suchmatters, taking hurried inventories of what it contained. Settingaside the wine and brandy, the entertainment was of the most liberalcharacter, and the whole arrangement extremely elegant. At each endof the table stood a large coffee-urn, surrounded with cups, themeaning of which was not long a mystery to the company. After theterrapin, oysters, salad, and their accompaniments, Mr. Eldridgesaid to a lady, in a half-hesitating voice, as if he were almostashamed to ask the question,--"Will you have a cup of coffee?""If you please," was the smiling answer. "Nothing would suit mebetter.""Delicious!" Mr. Eldridge heard one of the gentlemen, of whom hestood most in dread, say. "This is indeed a treat. I wouldn't givesuch a cup of coffee for the best glass of wine you could bring me.""I am glad you are pleased," Mr. Eldridge could not help remarking,as he turned to the gentleman."You couldn't have pleased me better," was replied.Soon the cups were circling through the room, and every one seemedto enjoy the rich beverage. It was not the ghost of coffee, norcoffee robbed of its delicate aroma; but clear, strong, fragrant,and mellowed by the most delicious cream. Having elected to servecoffee, Mrs. Eldridge was careful that her entertainment should notprove a failure through any lack of excellence in this article. Andit was very far from proving a failure. The first surprise beingover, one and another began to express an opinion on the subject tothe host and hostess."Let me thank you," said a lady, taking the hand of Mrs. Eldridge,and speaking very warmly, "for your courage in making thisinnovation upon a custom of doubtful prudence. I thank you, as amother, who has two sons here to-night."She said no more, but Mrs. Eldridge understood well her wholemeaning."You are a brave man, and I honor you," was the remark of agentleman to Mr. Eldridge. "There will be many, I think, to followyour good example. I should never have had the courage to lead, butI think I shall be brave enough to follow, when it comes my turn toentertain my friends."Henry was standing by his father when this was said listening withrespectful, but deeply gratified attention."My son, sir," said Mr. Eldridge.The gentleman took the boy by the hand, and while he held it, thefather added,--"I must let the honor go to where it really is due. The suggestioncame from him. He is a Cadet of Temperance, and when the party wastalked of, he pleaded so earnestly for the substitution of coffeefor wine and brandy, and used such good reason for the change, thatwe saw only one right course before us, and that we have adopted."The gentleman, on hearing this, shook the lad's hand warmly, andsaid,--"Your father has reason to be proud of you, my brave boy! There isno telling what good may grew out of this thing. Others will followyour father's example, and hundreds of young men be saved from theenticements of the wine cup."With what strong throbs of pleasure did the boy's heart beat whenthese words came to his ears! He had scarcely hoped for success whenhe pleaded briefly, but earnestly, with his mother. Yet he felt thathe must speak, for to his mind, what she proposed doing was a greatevil. Since it had been resolved to banish liquor from theentertainment, he had heard his father and mother speak severaltimes doubtfully as to the result; and more than once his fatherexpressed result that any such "foolish" attempt to run in the faceof people's prejudices had been thought of. Naturally, he had feltanxious about the result; but now that the affair had gone off sotriumphantly, his heart was outgushing with pleasure.The result was as had been predicted. Four parties were given to thebride, and in each case the good example of Mrs. Eldridge wasfollowed. Coffee took the place of wine and brandy, and it was theremark of nearly all, that there had been no pleasant parties duringthe season.So much for what a boy may do, by only a few right words spoken atthe right time, and in the right manner. Henry Eldridge wasthoughtful, modest, and earnest-minded. His attachment to the causeof temperance was not a mere boyish enthusiasm, but the result of aconviction that intemperance was a vice destructive, to both souland body, and one that lay like a curse and a plague-spot onsociety, He could understand how, if the boys rejected, entirely,the cup of confusion, the next, generation of men would be sober;and this had led him to join the Cadets, and do all in his power toget other lads to join also. In drawing other lads into the order,he had been very successful; and now, in a few respectfully uttered,but earnest words, he had checked the progress of intemperance in acircle far beyond the ordinary reach of his influence.Henry Eldridge was a happy boy that night.10 Add  Coffee vs. Brandy to your library.Return to the T.S.

Thesequestions fairly haunted him; and he regretted, over and over again,that he had yielded to his wife and excluded the liquors.But there was no holding back now; the die was cast, and they muststand to the issue. Mr. Eldridge tried to speak pleasantly to thelady on his arm, as he ascended to the supper-room; but the wordscame heavily from his tongue, for his heart was dying in him. Soonthe company were around the table, and eyes, critical in suchmatters, taking hurried inventories of what it contained. Settingaside the wine and brandy, the entertainment was of the most liberalcharacter, and the whole arrangement extremely elegant. At each endof the table stood a large coffee-urn, surrounded with cups, themeaning of which was not long a mystery to the company. After theterrapin, oysters, salad, and their accompaniments, Mr. Eldridgesaid to a lady, in a half-hesitating voice, as if he were almostashamed to ask the question,--"Will you have a cup of coffee?""If you please," was the smiling answer. "Nothing would suit mebetter.""Delicious!" Mr. Eldridge heard one of the gentlemen, of whom hestood most in dread, say. "This is indeed a treat. I wouldn't givesuch a cup of coffee for the best glass of wine you could bring me.""I am glad you are pleased," Mr. Eldridge could not help remarking,as he turned to the gentleman."You couldn't have pleased me better," was replied.Soon the cups were circling through the room, and every one seemedto enjoy the rich beverage. It was not the ghost of coffee, norcoffee robbed of its delicate aroma; but clear, strong, fragrant,and mellowed by the most delicious cream. Having elected to servecoffee, Mrs. Eldridge was careful that her entertainment should notprove a failure through any lack of excellence in this article. Andit was very far from proving a failure. The first surprise beingover, one and another began to express an opinion on the subject tothe host and hostess."Let me thank you," said a lady, taking the hand of Mrs. Eldridge,and speaking very warmly, "for your courage in making thisinnovation upon a custom of doubtful prudence. I thank you, as amother, who has two sons here to-night."She said no more, but Mrs. Eldridge understood well her wholemeaning."You are a brave man, and I honor you," was the remark of agentleman to Mr. Eldridge. "There will be many, I think, to followyour good example. I should never have had the courage to lead, butI think I shall be brave enough to follow, when it comes my turn toentertain my friends."Henry was standing by his father when this was said listening withrespectful, but deeply gratified attention."My son, sir," said Mr. Eldridge.The gentleman took the boy by the hand, and while he held it, thefather added,--"I must let the honor go to where it really is due. The suggestioncame from him. He is a Cadet of Temperance, and when the party wastalked of, he pleaded so earnestly for the substitution of coffeefor wine and brandy, and used such good reason for the change, thatwe saw only one right course before us, and that we have adopted."The gentleman, on hearing this, shook the lad's hand warmly, andsaid,--"Your father has reason to be proud of you, my brave boy! There isno telling what good may grew out of this thing. Others will followyour father's example, and hundreds of young men be saved from theenticements of the wine cup."With what strong throbs of pleasure did the boy's heart beat whenthese words came to his ears! He had scarcely hoped for success whenhe pleaded briefly, but earnestly, with his mother. Yet he felt thathe must speak, for to his mind, what she proposed doing was a greatevil. Since it had been resolved to banish liquor from theentertainment, he had heard his father and mother speak severaltimes doubtfully as to the result; and more than once his fatherexpressed result that any such "foolish" attempt to run in the faceof people's prejudices had been thought of. Naturally, he had feltanxious about the result; but now that the affair had gone off sotriumphantly, his heart was outgushing with pleasure.The result was as had been predicted. Four parties were given to thebride, and in each case the good example of Mrs. Eldridge wasfollowed. Coffee took the place of wine and brandy, and it was theremark of nearly all, that there had been no pleasant parties duringthe season.So much for what a boy may do, by only a few right words spoken atthe right time, and in the right manner. Henry Eldridge wasthoughtful, modest, and earnest-minded. His attachment to the causeof temperance was not a mere boyish enthusiasm, but the result of aconviction that intemperance was a vice destructive, to both souland body, and one that lay like a curse and a plague-spot onsociety, He could understand how, if the boys rejected, entirely,the cup of confusion, the next, generation of men would be sober;and this had led him to join the Cadets, and do all in his power toget other lads to join also. In drawing other lads into the order,he had been very successful; and now, in a few respectfully uttered,but earnest words, he had checked the progress of intemperance in acircle far beyond the ordinary reach of his influence.Henry Eldridge was a happy boy that night.10 Add  Coffee vs. Brandy to your library.Return to the T.S.

On this time the thoughts of the host and hostess hadpassed, ever and anon, during the whole evening, and not withoutmany misgivings as to the effect their entertainment would produceon the minds of the company. Mr. Eldridge was particularly nervouson the subject. There were several gentlemen present whom he knew tobe lovers of good wine; gentlemen at whose houses he had often beenentertained, and never without the exhilarating glass. How wouldthey feel? What would they think? What would they say? Thesequestions fairly haunted him; and he regretted, over and over again,that he had yielded to his wife and excluded the liquors.But there was no holding back now; the die was cast, and they muststand to the issue. Mr. Eldridge tried to speak pleasantly to thelady on his arm, as he ascended to the supper-room; but the wordscame heavily from his tongue, for his heart was dying in him. Soonthe company were around the table, and eyes, critical in suchmatters, taking hurried inventories of what it contained. Settingaside the wine and brandy, the entertainment was of the most liberalcharacter, and the whole arrangement extremely elegant. At each endof the table stood a large coffee-urn, surrounded with cups, themeaning of which was not long a mystery to the company. After theterrapin, oysters, salad, and their accompaniments, Mr. Eldridgesaid to a lady, in a half-hesitating voice, as if he were almostashamed to ask the question,--"Will you have a cup of coffee?""If you please," was the smiling answer. "Nothing would suit mebetter.""Delicious!" Mr. Eldridge heard one of the gentlemen, of whom hestood most in dread, say. "This is indeed a treat. I wouldn't givesuch a cup of coffee for the best glass of wine you could bring me.""I am glad you are pleased," Mr. Eldridge could not help remarking,as he turned to the gentleman."You couldn't have pleased me better," was replied.Soon the cups were circling through the room, and every one seemedto enjoy the rich beverage. It was not the ghost of coffee, norcoffee robbed of its delicate aroma; but clear, strong, fragrant,and mellowed by the most delicious cream. Having elected to servecoffee, Mrs. Eldridge was careful that her entertainment should notprove a failure through any lack of excellence in this article. Andit was very far from proving a failure. The first surprise beingover, one and another began to express an opinion on the subject tothe host and hostess."Let me thank you," said a lady, taking the hand of Mrs. Eldridge,and speaking very warmly, "for your courage in making thisinnovation upon a custom of doubtful prudence. I thank you, as amother, who has two sons here to-night."She said no more, but Mrs. Eldridge understood well her wholemeaning."You are a brave man, and I honor you," was the remark of agentleman to Mr. Eldridge. "There will be many, I think, to followyour good example. I should never have had the courage to lead, butI think I shall be brave enough to follow, when it comes my turn toentertain my friends."Henry was standing by his father when this was said listening withrespectful, but deeply gratified attention."My son, sir," said Mr. Eldridge.The gentleman took the boy by the hand, and while he held it, thefather added,--"I must let the honor go to where it really is due. The suggestioncame from him. He is a Cadet of Temperance, and when the party wastalked of, he pleaded so earnestly for the substitution of coffeefor wine and brandy, and used such good reason for the change, thatwe saw only one right course before us, and that we have adopted."The gentleman, on hearing this, shook the lad's hand warmly, andsaid,--"Your father has reason to be proud of you, my brave boy! There isno telling what good may grew out of this thing. Others will followyour father's example, and hundreds of young men be saved from theenticements of the wine cup."With what strong throbs of pleasure did the boy's heart beat whenthese words came to his ears! He had scarcely hoped for success whenhe pleaded briefly, but earnestly, with his mother. Yet he felt thathe must speak, for to his mind, what she proposed doing was a greatevil. Since it had been resolved to banish liquor from theentertainment, he had heard his father and mother speak severaltimes doubtfully as to the result; and more than once his fatherexpressed result that any such "foolish" attempt to run in the faceof people's prejudices had been thought of. Naturally, he had feltanxious about the result; but now that the affair had gone off sotriumphantly, his heart was outgushing with pleasure.The result was as had been predicted. Four parties were given to thebride, and in each case the good example of Mrs. Eldridge wasfollowed. Coffee took the place of wine and brandy, and it was theremark of nearly all, that there had been no pleasant parties duringthe season.So much for what a boy may do, by only a few right words spoken atthe right time, and in the right manner. Henry Eldridge wasthoughtful, modest, and earnest-minded. His attachment to the causeof temperance was not a mere boyish enthusiasm, but the result of aconviction that intemperance was a vice destructive, to both souland body, and one that lay like a curse and a plague-spot onsociety, He could understand how, if the boys rejected, entirely,the cup of confusion, the next, generation of men would be sober;and this had led him to join the Cadets, and do all in his power toget other lads to join also. In drawing other lads into the order,he had been very successful; and now, in a few respectfully uttered,but earnest words, he had checked the progress of intemperance in acircle far beyond the ordinary reach of his influence.Henry Eldridge was a happy boy that night.10 Add  Coffee vs. Brandy to your library.Return to the T.S.

Settingaside the wine and brandy, the entertainment was of the most liberalcharacter, and the whole arrangement extremely elegant. At each endof the table stood a large coffee-urn, surrounded with cups, themeaning of which was not long a mystery to the company.

I thank you, as amother, who has two sons here to-night."She said no more, but Mrs. Eldridge understood well her wholemeaning."You are a brave man, and I honor you," was the remark of agentleman to Mr. Eldridge. "There will be many, I think, to followyour good example. I should never have had the courage to lead, butI think I shall be brave enough to follow, when it comes my turn toentertain my friends."Henry was standing by his father when this was said listening withrespectful, but deeply gratified attention."My son, sir," said Mr. Eldridge.The gentleman took the boy by the hand, and while he held it, thefather added,--"I must let the honor go to where it really is due. The suggestioncame from him. He is a Cadet of Temperance, and when the party wastalked of, he pleaded so earnestly for the substitution of coffeefor wine and brandy, and used such good reason for the change, thatwe saw only one right course before us, and that we have adopted."The gentleman, on hearing this, shook the lad's hand warmly, andsaid,--"Your father has reason to be proud of you, my brave boy! There isno telling what good may grew out of this thing. Others will followyour father's example, and hundreds of young men be saved from theenticements of the wine cup."With what strong throbs of pleasure did the boy's heart beat whenthese words came to his ears! He had scarcely hoped for success whenhe pleaded briefly, but earnestly, with his mother. Yet he felt thathe must speak, for to his mind, what she proposed doing was a greatevil. Since it had been resolved to banish liquor from theentertainment, he had heard his father and mother speak severaltimes doubtfully as to the result; and more than once his fatherexpressed result that any such "foolish" attempt to run in the faceof people's prejudices had been thought of. Naturally, he had feltanxious about the result; but now that the affair had gone off sotriumphantly, his heart was outgushing with pleasure.The result was as had been predicted. Four parties were given to thebride, and in each case the good example of Mrs. Eldridge wasfollowed. Coffee took the place of wine and brandy, and it was theremark of nearly all, that there had been no pleasant parties duringthe season.So much for what a boy may do, by only a few right words spoken atthe right time, and in the right manner. Henry Eldridge wasthoughtful, modest, and earnest-minded. His attachment to the causeof temperance was not a mere boyish enthusiasm, but the result of aconviction that intemperance was a vice destructive, to both souland body, and one that lay like a curse and a plague-spot onsociety, He could understand how, if the boys rejected, entirely,the cup of confusion, the next, generation of men would be sober;and this had led him to join the Cadets, and do all in his power toget other lads to join also. In drawing other lads into the order,he had been very successful; and now, in a few respectfully uttered,but earnest words, he had checked the progress of intemperance in acircle far beyond the ordinary reach of his influence.Henry Eldridge was a happy boy that night.10 Add  Coffee vs. Brandy to your library.Return to the T.S.
