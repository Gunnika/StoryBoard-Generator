Broad gold, the evening colors glow,The April air is cool and tender.You should have come ten years ago,And yet in welcome I surrender.Come here, sit closer in our nook,And turn gay eyes at what my nursesMight never glimpse: the blue-bound bookThat holds my awkward childish verses.Forgive me that I did not lookSunward with joy, but dwelt with sorrow,Forgive me all whom I mistookFor you, oblivious of the morrow. 7 Add  "Broad Gold, the Evening" to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
