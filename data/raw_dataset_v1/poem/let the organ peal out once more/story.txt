Let the organ peal out once more,Like a first spring thunderstorm;From behind your bride's shoulder,My half-closed eyes will gaze.Farewell, goodbye, be happy my friend,Ireturn you your sweet vow,But don't let your passionate oneSee my inimitable ravings –That would inject a burning venomInto your blessed, joyful union…And I go to claim a marvellous gardenWhere grass rustles, the Muse declaims. 3 Add  'Let the organ peal out once more,' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
