It was not mystery or grief,Nor the wise will of fate –It was the impression of strife,Our meetings always left behind.From dawn I'd anticipateThe moment when you'd appear,Feeling faint stabbing painsAll along my folded arms.And with dry fingers I'd crumpleThe table's chequered cloth…I knew then, already,How small this earth truly is. 7.7 Add  'It was not mystery or grief,' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
