Everything's looted, betrayed and traded,Black death's wing's overhead.Everything's eaten by hunger, un-sated,So why does a light shine ahead?By day, a mysterious wood, near the town,Breathes out cherry, a cherry perfume.By night, on July's sky, deep, and transparent,New constellations are thrown.And something miraculous will comeClose to the darkness and ruin,Something no-one, no-one, has known,Though we've longed for it since we were children. 6.8 Add  'Everything's looted, betrayed and traded,' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
