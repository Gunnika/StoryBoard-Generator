Amongst the grandeur of Hua ShanI climb to the Flower Peak,and fancy I see fairies and immortalscarrying lotus in theirsacred white hands, robes flowingthey fly filling the sky with colouras they rise to the palace of heaven,inviting me to go to the cloud stageand see Wei Shu-ching, guardian angelof Hua Shan; so dreamily I go with themriding to the sky on the backof wild geese which call as they fly,but when we look below at Loyang,not so clear because of the mist,everywhere could be seen lootingarmies, which took Loyang, creatingchaos and madness with bloodflowing everywhere; like animals of preyrebel army men made into officialswith caps and robes to match. 8 Add  Climbing West Of Lotus Flower Peak to your library.Return to the Li Bai library, or . . .
