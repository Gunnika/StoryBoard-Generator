I don't know if you're alive or dead -Can you be found on earth so?Or only in twilit thoughts instead,Be mourned, in that peaceful glow?All for you: the prayer by day,The hot sleeplessness at night,The white flock of poetry,And the blue fire of my eyes.No one was cherished more,Or made me suffer: no, notHe who betrayed me to torment,Nor he who caressed and forgot. 6.5 Add  'I don't know if you're alive or dead -' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
