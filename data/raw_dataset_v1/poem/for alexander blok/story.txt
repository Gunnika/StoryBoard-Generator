I came to the poet as a guest.Exactly at noon. On Sunday.Beyond the window, frost,Quiet in the room's space.And a raspberry tinted sunAbove tangles of blue smokeâ€¦How clearly the taciturnMaster turns, on me, his look!His eyes are of that kindRemembered by one and all:Better take care, mind:Don't gaze at them at all.But I remember our words,Smoky noon, of a Sunday,In that high grey houseBy the Neva's sea-way. 4.7 Add  For Alexander Blok to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
