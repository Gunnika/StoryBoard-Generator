I'll erase this day from your memory,So your vague helpless gaze will askWhere you saw Persian lilac,Swallows, and this wooden house.Oh, how often you'll rememberThe sudden pain of unnamed longing,And in townships seek in dreamFor a street that isn't on the map!At the sight of every chance letter,When a voice sounds from an open door,You'll think: 'It's she, who's hereBringing help to the non-believer.' 7.3 Add  'I'll erase this day from your memory,' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
