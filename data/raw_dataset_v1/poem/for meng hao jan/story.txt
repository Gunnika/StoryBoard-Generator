I love Master Meng.Free as a flowing breeze,He is famousThroughout the world.In rosy youth, he cast awayOfficial cap and carriage.Now, a white-haired elder, he reclinesAmid pines and cloud.Drunk beneath the moon,He often attains sagehood.Lost among the flowers,He serves no lord.How can I aspireto such a high mountain?Here below, to his clear fragrance,I bow. 8 Add  For Meng Hao-Jan to your library.Return to the Li Bai library, or . . .
