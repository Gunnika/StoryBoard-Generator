The fields are chill, the sparse rain has stopped;The colours of Spring teem on every side.With leaping fish the blue pond is full;With singing thrushes the green boughs droop.The flowers of the field have dabbled their powdered cheeks;The mountain grasses are bent level at the waist.By the bamboo stream the last fragment of cloudBlown by the wind slowly scatters away. 6 Add  Clearing at Dawn to your library.Return to the Li Bai library, or . . .
