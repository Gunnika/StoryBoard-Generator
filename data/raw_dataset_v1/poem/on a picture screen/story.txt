Whence these twelve peaks of Wu-shan!Have they flown into the gorgeous screenFrom heaven's one corner?Ah, those lonely pines murmuring in the wind!Those palaces of Yang-tai, hovering yonderOh, the melancholy of it!Where the jeweled couch of the kingWith brocade covers is desolate,His elfin maid voluptuously fairStill haunting them in vain!Here a few feetSeem a thousand miles.The craggy walls glisten blue and red,A piece of dazzling embroidery.How green those distant trees areRound the river strait of Ching-men!And those ships they go on,Floating on the waters of Pa.The water sings over the rocksBetween countless hillsOf shining mist and lustrous grass.How many years since these valley flowers bloomedTo smile in the sun ?And that man traveling on the river,Hears he not for ages the monkeys screaming?Whoever looks on this,Loses himself in eternity;And entering the sacred mountains of Sung,He will dream among the resplendent clouds. 7 Add  On A Picture Screen to your library.Return to the Li Bai library, or . . .
