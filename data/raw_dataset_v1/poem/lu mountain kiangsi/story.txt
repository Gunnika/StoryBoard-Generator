I climbed west on Incense Cloud Peak.South I saw the spray-filled fallsDropping for ten thousand feetSounding in a hundred gorges,Suddenly as if lightning shone,Strange as if light-wet rainbows lifted.I thought the Milky Way had shattered,Scattering stars through the clouds, downwards.Looking up an even greater force.Nature's powers are so intense.The Cosmic Wind blows there without stop.The river's moon echoes back the lightInto vortices where waters rush.On both sides the clear walls were washed,By streams of pearl broken into mist,By clouds of foam whitening over rock.Let me reach those Sublime HillsWhere peace comes to the quiet heart.No more need to find the magic cup.I'll wash the dust, there, from my face,And live in those regions that I love,Separated from the Human World. 6 Add  Lu Mountain, Kiangsi to your library.Return to the Li Bai library, or . . .
