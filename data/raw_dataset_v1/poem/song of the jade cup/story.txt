A jade cup was broken because old age cametoo soon to give fulfilment to hopes; after drinkingthree cups of wine I wiped my sword andstarted to dance under an autumn moon firstsinging in a high voice then unable to halttears coming; I remember the day when firstI was summoned to court and I was feasted splendidlywriting poems in praise of the Emperor, makingjokes with officials around several times changingmy horse, taking the best from theimperial stables; with my whip studded withjade and coral presented to me by the Emperor,my life was free and easy, people calling methe "Banished Immortal." Hsi Shih was goodat smiling as well as frowning, uselessfor ordinary girls to try and imitate her.Surely it was only her loveliness the king adored,but unfortunately jealousy within the palaceled to her death. 7.5 Add  Song Of The Jade Cup to your library.Return to the Li Bai library, or . . .
