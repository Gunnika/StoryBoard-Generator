All's as it was: the snowstorm'sFine flakes wet the window pane,And I myself am not new-born,But a man came to me today.I asked: 'What do you wish?'He said: 'To be with you in hell'.Ilaughed: 'Ah, sadly,No: perhaps you wish me ill.'But, his dry hand touchedA petal with a light caress:'Tell me, how they kiss you,Tell me, how you kiss.'And his eyes, dully gazing,Never lifted from my ring.Not a single muscle shiftingBeneath that evil-glistening.O, I understand: to know, passionatelyAnd intensely, is his delight,That there's nothing that he needs,And nothing I can deny. 8 Add  The Guest to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
