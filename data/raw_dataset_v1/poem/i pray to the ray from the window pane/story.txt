I pray to the ray from the window-pane –It's pale, thin, and straight.All morning I was silent,My heart – split in two.The copper of my wash-basinIs green with verdigris,But sunlight plays there,How joyously.So simple it is, so innocent,In evening quiet,Yet in this bare shrine,It's a gold celebration,A consolation, I find. 6.5 Add  'I pray to the ray from the window-pane' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
