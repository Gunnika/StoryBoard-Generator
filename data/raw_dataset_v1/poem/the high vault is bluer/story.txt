The high vault is bluerThan the sky's solid blue…Forgive me, happy boy,The death I brought you –For the roses from every place,For your foolish words,That your bold dark facePale with love, stirred.Ithought: your purpose –To show an adult's pride.Ithought it's not possible:Love, as one loves a bride.I was wrong in every way.When the weather grew icy,Everywhere, and always,You followed, impassively,As if you wanted to showI'd no love for you. Forgive!Why did you take that vowOn the path to suffering?And death held out its hand…oh,Speak, why then, what for?I didn't know how frail your throatWas under the blue collar.Happy boy, my tormentedOwlet, oh, forgive me!Today, I find it hardTo leave this sanctuary. 3 Add  'The high vault is bluer' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
