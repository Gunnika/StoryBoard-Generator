My heart was chilled and numb,But my feet were light.I fumbled the glove for my left handOnto my right.It seemed there were many steps,I knew â€“ there were only three.Autumn, whispering in the maples,Kept urging: 'Die with me!I'm cheated by joylessness,Changed by a destiny untrue.'I answered: 'My dear, my dear!I too: I'll die with you.'The song of the last meeting.I see that dark house again.Only bedroom candles burning,With a yellow, indifferent, flame. 8.2 Add  Song of the Last Meeting to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
