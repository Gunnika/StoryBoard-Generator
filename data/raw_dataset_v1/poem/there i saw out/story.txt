There I saw outMy twenty-first year,Sweet in the mouthThe dark, sultry honey.On the twigs I toreMy white silk dress,In the bowed pine,The nightingale never rested.At the cry of convention,It flies from its perch,Like a woodland spirit,Like a tender sister.Swiftly climbing the hill,Swimming over the river,Yes, and later,Don't tell: leave me be. 5.5 Add  'There I saw out' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
