No one sung about that meeting,Sadness faded with never a song.A cool summer it was,Like a new life begun.The sky seems a vault of stone,Wounded by yellow fire,And more than my daily breadI need some word of him.Dew-wet grassRefresh my soul with news â€“Not for passion, or for pleasure,But for deep love of this earth. 6.5 Add  'No one sung about that meeting,' to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
