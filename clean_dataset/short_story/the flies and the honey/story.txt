A jar of honey was upset and the sticky sweetness flowed out onthe table. The sweet smell of the honey soon brought a largenumber of Flies buzzing around. They did not wait for aninvitation. No, indeed; they settled right down, feet and all, togorge themselves. The Flies were quickly smeared from head tofoot with honey. Their wings stuck together. They could not pulltheir feet out of the sticky mass. And so they died, giving theirlives for the sake of a taste of sweetness. Be not greedy for a little passing pleasure. It may destroyyou. A related adage: "You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar."9.3 Add  The Flies And The Honey to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
