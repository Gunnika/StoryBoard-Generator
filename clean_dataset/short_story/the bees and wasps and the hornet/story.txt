A store of honey had been found in a hollow tree, and the Waspsdeclared positively that it belonged to them. The Bees were justas sure that the treasure was theirs. The argument grew verypointed, and it looked as if the affair could not be settledwithout a battle, when at last, with much good sense, theyagreed to let a judge decide the matter. So they brought thecase before the Hornet, justice of the peace in that part of thewoods. When the Judge called the case, witnesses declared that they hadseen certain winged creatures in the neighborhood of the hollowtree, who hummed loudly, and whose bodies were striped, yellowand black, like Bees. Counsel for the Wasps immediately insisted that this descriptionfitted his clients exactly. Such evidence did not help Judge Hornet to any decision, so headjourned court for six weeks to give him time to think it over.When the case came up again, both sides had a large number ofwitnesses. An Ant was first to take the stand, and was about tobe cross-examined, when a wise old Bee addressed the Court. "Your honor," he said, "the case has now been pending for sixweeks. If it is not decided soon, the honey will not be fit foranything. I move that the Bees and the Wasps be both instructedto build a honey comb. Then we shall soon see to whom the honeyreally belongs." The Wasps protested loudly. Wise Judge Hornet quickly understoodwhy they did so: They knew they could not build a honey comb andfill it with honey. "It is clear," said the Judge, "who made the comb and who couldnot have made it. The honey belongs to the Bees."
