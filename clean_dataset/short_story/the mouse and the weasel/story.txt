A little hungry Mouse found his way one day into a basket ofcorn. He had to squeeze himself a good deal to get through thenarrow opening between the strips of the basket. But the corn wastempting and the Mouse was determined to get in. When at last hehad succeeded, he gorged himself to bursting. Indeed he he becameabout three times as big around the middle as he was when he wentin. At last he felt satisfied and dragged himself to the opening toget out again. But the best he could do was to get his head out.So there he sat groaning and moaning, both from the discomfortinside him and his anxiety to escape from the basket. Just then a Weasel came by. He understood the situation quickly. "My friend," he said, "I know what you've been doing. You've beenstuffing. That's what you get. You will have to stay there tillyou feel just like you did when you went in. Good night, and goodenough for you." And that was all the sympathy the poor Mouse got. Greediness leads to misfortune. 8.4 Add  The Mouse And The Weasel to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
