The Peacock, they say, did not at first have the beautifulfeathers in which he now takes so much pride. These, Juno, whosefavorite he was, granted to him one day when he begged her for atrain of feathers to distinguish him from the other birds. Then,decked in his finery, gleaming with emerald, gold, purple, andazure, he strutted proudly among the birds. All regarded him withenvy. Even the most beautiful pheasant could see that his beautywas surpassed. Presently the Peacock saw an Eagle soaring high up in the bluesky and felt a desire to fly, as he had been accustomed to do.Lifting his wings he tried to rise from the ground. But theweight of his magnificent train held him down. Instead of flyingup to greet the first rays of the morning sun or to bathe in therosy light among the floating clouds at sunset, he would have towalk the ground more encumbered and oppressed than any commonbarnyard fowl.
