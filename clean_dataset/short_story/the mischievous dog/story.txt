There was once a Dog who was so ill-natured and mischievous thathis Master had to fasten a heavy wooden clog about his neck tokeep him from annoying visitors and neighbors. But the Dog seemedto be very proud of the clog and dragged it about noisily as ifhe wished to attract everybody's attention. He was not able toimpress anyone. "You would be wiser," said an old acquaintance, "to keep quietlyout of sight with that clog. Do you want everybody to know what adisgraceful and ill-natured Dog you are?"
