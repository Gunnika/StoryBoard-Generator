A Miser had buried his gold in a secret place in his garden.Every day he went to the spot, dug up the treasure and counted itpiece by piece to make sure it was all there. He made so manytrips that a Thief, who had been observing him, guessed what itwas the Miser had hidden, and one night quietly dug up thetreasure and made off with it. When the Miser discovered his loss, he was overcome with griefand despair. He groaned and cried and tore his hair. A passerby heard his cries and asked what had happened. "My gold! O my gold!" cried the Miser, wildly, "someone hasrobbed me!" "Your gold! There in that hole? Why did you put it there? Why didyou not keep it in the house where you could easily get it whenyou had to buy things?" "Buy!" screamed the Miser angrily. "Why, I never touched thegold. I couldn't think of spending any of it." The stranger picked up a large stone and threw it into the hole. "If that is the case," he said, "cover up that stone. It is worthjust as much to you as the treasure you lost!" A possession is worth no more than the use we make of it. 8.4 Add  The Miser to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
