A Fir-tree was boasting to a Bramble, and said, somewhat contemptuously, "You poor creature, you are of no use whatever. Now, look at me: I am useful for all sorts of things, particularly when men build houses; they can't do without me then." But the Bramble replied, "Ah, that's all very well: but you wait till they come with axes and saws to cut you down, and then you'll wish you were a Bramble and not a Fir." Better poverty without a care than wealth with its many obligations.8.5 Add  The Fir-Tree and the Bramble to your library.Return to the Aesop library, or . . .
